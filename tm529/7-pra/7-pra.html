# Learning outcomes

Overview of chapters 15 and 16 in the book and other material I found

Understanding how to integrate analytical tools to form a PRA

This is a bit of a mash
---
## [PRA](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-38-probability-and-its-applications-to-reliability-quality-control-and-risk-assessment-fall-2005/lecture-notes/sec12_pra_aposta.pdf) is the NRC regulatory paradigm now

Surprisingly, this is not the case with many industries

[Defense-in-Depth](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/srm/1998/1998-144srm.pdf) is an element of the NRC’s safety philosophy that employs successive compensatory measures to prevent accidents or mitigate damage if a malfunction, accident, or naturally caused event occurs at a nuclear facility

Design Basis Accidents are postulated accidents that a nuclear facility must be designed and built to withstand without loss to the systems, structures, and components necessary to assure public health and safety

Essential to PRA
---
## PRA can inform system or facility design

Facility must be operated without undue risk to public health and safety

A single failure of any active component (assuming passive components function properly) nor (2) a single failure of a passive component (assuming active components function properly), results in a loss of the capability of the system to perform its safety functions

So don't have something fail and the whole place blows up

Defense in depth mitigates single failures  
For nuclear, this deals with LOCA  

So they came up with criteria to avoid this  
Need a heat sink and coolant source (Generation III+)  
Cladding temperature, long term cooling, accident tolerant fuels etc.
---
## Farmer came up with his chart in 1967 for I-131
![Farmers chart](img/farmers.chart.jpg)
---
## [I-131](http://www.radioactivity.eu.com/site/pages/Iodine_131.htm) is a major threat to health in a nuclear plant accident

He considered the public acceptability of risk  
Whole spectrum of events needs to be considered  
Not just worst case (which would be low frequency)

Low consequence but more probable carries equal risk

Postulated a near-inverse for acceptable risk  
Events with twice the consequence must be half as frequent
---
## [WASH-1400](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/pra-2/) came along in 1975

First formalized use of PRA; fault and events trees, etc.

Dominant contributors to risk were small LOCAs and transients

Core damage frequency higher than what was thought at the time  
But consquences smaller

Support systems and operator actions very important

Change in the reactor coolant system temperature, pressure, or both, attributed to a change in the reactor’s power output
---
## The report was [reviewed by experts](http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/10/452/10452296.pdf)

1. Clarify the achievements and limitations of WASH-1400  
2. Assess the peer comments thereon, and responses  
3. Study the present state of such risk assessment methodology  
4. Recommend to the NRC how (whether) such methodology can be used in the regulatory and licensing process

"WASH-1400 was a conscientious and honest effort to apply the methods of fault-tree/event-tree analysis to an extremely complex system, a nuclear reactor, in order to determine the overall probability and consequences of an accident."
---
## They identified several problems we still talk about

"Inability to quantify human adaptability during the course of an accident"

"Inadequate treatment of common cause failure"

"We are unable to define whether the overall probability of a core melt given in WASH-1400 is high or low, but we are certain that the error bands are understated. We cannot say by how much. Reasons for this include an inadequate data base, a poor statistical treatment, an inconsistent
propagation of uncertainties throughout the calculation, etc."

Even with all the operational history to drawn upon, they still have problems
---
## Risk assessment itself though was considered good

"We do find that the methodology, which was an important advance over earlier methodologies applied to reactor risks, is sound, and should be developed and used more widely under circumstances in which there is an adequate data base or sufficient technical expertise to insert credible subjective probabilities into the calculations."

"The methodology can therefore provide a tool for the NRC to make the licensing and regulatory process more rational, in more properly matching its resources (research, quality assurance, inspection, licensing regulations) to the risks provided by the proper application of the methodology."
---
## They didn't like how it was written though

"It is very difficult to follow the detailed thread of any calculation through the report."

"We find that the Executive Summary is a poor description of the contents of the report, should not be portrayed as such, and has lent itself to misuse in the discussion of reactor risks."
---
class: center,middle
### "We find that the fault-tree/event-tree methodology is sound, and both can and should be more widely used by NRC. The implementation of this methodology in WASH-1400 was a pioneering step, but leaves much to be desired."
---
class: center,middle
### Other major findings within the context of risk assessment
---
1. WASH-1400 was a substantial advance over previous attempts to estimate the risks of the nuclear option. The methodology has set a framework that can be used more broadly to assess choices involving both technical consequences and impacts on humans.

(We use nuclear option quite differently today).

2. 
---
## The follow up to WASH1400 was [NUREG1150](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/pra-2/) in 1990

Average probability of an individual early fatality per reactor per year

NRC Safety Goal: 5E-07

Level I PRA methods generally sound

Concerns with human reliability analysis, common cause failures, data analysis

Same things we talk about today
---
![CDF](img/cdf.jpg)

![Cesium release](img/cesium.release.jpg)
---
![Iodine release](img/iodine.release.jpg)
---
## The NRC issued a [policy statement](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/risk-informed/history.html) in 1995

Use of PRA should be increased to the extent supported by the state of the art and data and in a manner that complements the defense-in-depth philosophy

PRA should be used to reduce unnecessary conservatisms associated with current regulatory requirements  
This is still kind of a problem

Insights derived from PRAs are used in combination with deterministic system analysis to focus licensee and regulatory attention on issues commensurate with their importance to safety

Use risk to inform decision making, not dictate the decision

Measurable parameters monitor plant and licensee performance
---
## Devise objective criteria to assess system performance 

Based on a combination of risk insights, deterministic analysis, and performance history  
Licensee flexibility to determine how to meet established performance criteria

Failure to meet a performance criterion must not result in unacceptable consequences

NPP needs to make sure when an earthquake hits that there is no care damage or release  
But how a CA plant does that v an MA plant is different

Risk informed, performance based regulations 

Another example?
---
## Doing a PRA is wicked hard

Models the whole system including hardware failures, human performance, and relevant physical phenomena

Which is why you need all these tools

When do you know the PRA is satisfactory, complete, comprehensive?

Knowing a priori is highly subjective and very difficult

Unknown unknowns

Still a reactive process
---
class: center,middle

# Common cause failures
---
## Failures result from events exhibiting dependencies

Or from a single shared cause and coupling factor

Sequence of item failures where the first failure shifts its load to one or more nearby items
such that these fail and again shift their load to other item, etc.

Cascade

Why did the item fail?  
Why were several items affected?
---
## Identify causes as part of facility or system design

Pre-operational causes stem from design, manufacturing, construction, installation

Operational causes stem from inadequate maintenance and operational procedures, execution, competence, scheduling

Redundancy and diversity  
Isolation (shielding, containment, separation)

There's lots of modeling for this (bayes and binomial distribution, tables)
---
![Common cause failures](img/common.cause.failures.jpg)

class: center,middle

# PRA  
## Putting it all together
---
## PRA was used by aviation and nuclear industry first, but now everyone uses it

Requires in depth knowledge of the system or process  
Fuel fabrication example

I have been studying pyroprocessing for years

Tools like fault/event trees, HAZOP, PHA, FMEA all contribute

We need to know what normal operation looks like

Identify deviations

Assign frequencies (with uncertainties)

Sensitivity analysis (HAZOP)
---
## Integrate all our tools to assess risk

Identify end states  

How can radiation be released?  

How could people become exposed?  

How could we lose a lot of money?

Characterize the system comprehensively   

You've all done some of this with all the homework projects
---
## Identify what data is going to be needed and how you would collect it

Select initiating events (hazards)

Define scenarios linking each initiating event to the end states  
Apply the trees, FMEA, HAZOP

Modeling where needed  
Material flow models  
Transport models  
Repository assessment  

Quantify risk for each initiating event  
Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
---
## Rank risk by importance

Farmers chart

Regulations

Peer review

Management - Coming up
---
## We have been focused largely on qualitative risk analysis

Risk assessment matrices 

Being able to do this is most of the job

Eventually, frequencies have to be developed

Parameters quantified with associated uncertainties

Models defined

More specific to the system to be analyzed
---
## Narrative research can be used to determine what happened

Way of understanding experience

Determining risk by looking at an event such as an airplane crash

You already did this for several examples

Narrative research incorporates personal observation, records, videos, pictures

Mitigate risk for future events

Again, still a retrospective process though
---
## Case study research can be used to apply a bounded system to other problems

Hyatt

Pinto --> GM ignition

Dreamliner

Bay bridge

TMI, Chernobyl, Fukushima

Takata air bags?

Doesn't need to be historical 
---
## Pedagogically, you want to teach fundamental principles, existing case studies

Then develop your own

So data gathering (what/importance) is important because you aren't modeling on your own, or using existing data in a model to further analyze the case
---
## Quantitative risk analysis is needed for the Farmer's chart and regulations

Ultimately needed for Level I,II,III PRA

We have initiating events and scenarios, including human effects

We know how to obtain failure rates and process data

Higher level statistical analysis used
Like Monte Carlo

Identify distributions for relevant parameters
Run the model

Establish confidence limits
---
## Consider repository assessment 

Wide variety of engineering and scientific disciplines to be needed

Geology, chemical engineering, environmental science, nuclear engineering

Even though we've been working on small-scale projects, you should be able to expand to this level

What is important is that risk has to be defined clearly for each system
---
class: center,middle
## There are two overall 'spaces' to consider with risk assessment
---
## 1. After the accident

Figure out what went wrong

Limit potential exposures and releases

Prevent future similar accidents

16.3 in the book
---
## 2. Facility/process/experimental operations

Demonstrate ahead of time what the risks are and how they meet institutional requirements

16.3.1. discusses again about the detection of small structural cracks in aircraft

You can't really establish a probability of detection of the cracks

But you can determine how experience would make detection more reliable

Knowing what parts are more prone to cracks

So you need qualitative efforts to determine this

Develop a survey to determine experience level of inspectors

Conduct a physical experiment to collect quantitative data from a lot of inspectors
