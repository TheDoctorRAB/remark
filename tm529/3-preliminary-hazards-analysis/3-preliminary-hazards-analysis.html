# What is a hazard?
---
# Preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) is a semi-quantitative analysis tool

Line item tabular inventory of non trivial system hazards and countermeasures

Best applied in the design and development stage  
(early phase risk assessment tool)

Identify all potential hazards and intiating events that may lead to an accident

Rank the identified events according to their severity  
Can be drawn from the risk assessment matrix from before
---
# Identify required hazard controls and follow-up actions

Systematic process to identify hazards, prioritize, and propose mitigation

To produce a Preliminary Hazard List

Leading to deeper analytical tools
 
Rapid Risk Ranking  
Hazard identification (HAZID)  
Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)  
Hazard and operability review (HAZOP)  
Human error analysis (HEA)

# [PHA is used as an initial risk study in the early stages of the project](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/preliminary-hazards-analysis/)

Initially developed by US Army  
"Army had half day, Mother!"

Used to review process areas of energy released in uncontrolled manner

Identify hazards and consequences  
Start as early as possible in system life cycle

Accidents are mainly caused by release of energy (table 6.3 in the book)  
chemical, electrical, mechanical
---
# Identify potential hazards where energy may be released  

mechanical moving parts  
material incompatibilities  
nuclear radiation  
electromagnetic radiation (laser, radio, UV, etc.)  
collisions from movement of personnel, equipment, automation

toxic materials and corrosive liquids, gases stored or generated  
all sorts of deterioration  
subsonic or supersonic noise  
biological, bacterial growth  
human error  
software, network, cyber-based 
---
# Identify accidental events (multiple) that may occur from each hazard 

Estimate frequency of hazards  
Estimate of the severity of each event  
We've done this, but stopped here  

Then  
Compare initial design concepts  
Focus on important risk issues  
Input for PRA   

You might be able to easily mitigate some events right at the start using PHA

Consider PHA to be the base level of risk analysis  
Not sufficient but a necessary start
---
# Adapt PHA to the system under study

Not everything is applicable to every system

Identify hazardous components or system elements

Facility related hazards and surrounding property

Interfaces between system elements related to safety (software)

Operational equipment  
Supporting equipment  
Safety equipment and related safeguards

Environmental constraints  
Operational constraints  
Leading to potential malfunctions to system and components
---
# Identify procedures related to operations, testing, maintenance, system diagnostics, emergencies

Obtain potential related data cohorts  
Reports, accident statistics, regulatory reviews if you know someone  
Or existing systems and PHAs  
Bring in some experts for an outside review

Model energy or material flow in the system and develop operational modes  
Review facility technical specifications if they are available  

Not so easy even though 'qualitative'
---
# PHA is most effectively used during the initial development of a process and the procedures for performing that process

In a PHA, idea is to list the hazards and not to analyze each step in the procedure  
Very top-level analysis, but when done properly, very useful for more comprehensive PRA

Would we really need this with mature systems?  
Like AP1000?
---
# Identify where each hazard will occur  

Significance   

Method to eliminate or mitigate   

How associated risk will be controlled
---
# Identify hazardous states of a system as part of the conceptual design phase

Something I can use in my own research

Establish framework  
input  
boundaries between the system(s)  
system interaction and dependencies  
system domain  
system functionality for each component and holistically  
layout  
process flow  
output
---
# Identify system hazards and materials

related accidents  

accident sequences  

energy use   
---
# Assign each accident a severity categorization

Quantify frequency of each accident sequence

Assign each hazard a preliminary random and systematic probability target  
6.1.1. in the book

Propose safety features needed during the design and development phase

You want to be able to head off low risk that can be mitigated by design and high risk that needs more work

### Forward analysis identifies events then consequences
![Forward PHA](img/forward.jpg)
---
### Backward analysis identifies hazards to find events
![Backward PHA](img/backward.jpg)
---
### Use top down analysis to decompose the events
![Top down](img/top.down.jpg)
---
### Use bottom up analysis to decompose the hazard
![Bottom up](img/bottom.up.jpg)
---
# PHA should take place during different stages in the life cycle

New facilities as part of design before committing resources

During construction, things are going to come up that were not anticipated  
We know what we know  
We know what we don't know  
We don't know what we don't know

Operational readiness must be conducted prior to system start up
---
# Periodic analyze during operational lifetime

Maybe due to regulations

Anytime there is a modification  
Safety analysis at USA nuclear plants after Fukushima  
NRC regulations for technical specification, performance based goals, best practices  

Finally, when decommissioning new hazards will arise  
Disposal of materials, chemicals, etc.

Really think about the wide range of engineering structures, facilities, etc., about how important this is
---
### Probability of occurrence of unexpected hazardous release determines credibility

Less than 1E-06: less than credible  
Not expected during facility lifetime

1E-06 - 1E-04: credible and extremely unlikely  
Probably not occur during facility lifetime

1E-04 - 1E-02: credible and unlikely  
May occur once during facility lifetime  
Natural phenomena  
Trained worker error (do not agree with this at all)

1E-02 - 1E-01: very likely  
Events may often occur
---
# If you can't guess at probabilities, estimate

Frequent: occurs often  
Likely: occurs several times  
Occasional: occurs sporadically  
Seldom: not negligible but unlikely  
Unlikely: neglibible 

These can be site or facility specific too
---
### Rank hazards in terms of qualitative consequences or severity

**Class I: negligible**  
worst case effects cause less than minor injury, occupational illness, system damage

**Class II: marginal effects**  
worse case effects cause minor occupational illness, system damage

**Class III: critical**  
worse case effects cause severe (nondisabling) personnel injury, severe occupational illness, major system damage

**Class IV: catastrophic**  
worse case effects cause death, disabling injury, system loss
---
# Most reliable solution is to eliminate source of hazard

No problem amirite?!

cf. Flushing automobile cooling system example in 6.2  and crib in 6.3
---
# Beware common cause events or multiple consequences

Different events may lead to similar consequences

Ranking hazards needs a normalized metric

So severity must be carefully determined 

Consequences should be characterized as precisely or descriptively as possible 

Estimate the frequency that initiating event produces a specific consequence 

This means that for each initiating event, there might be several consequences with associated frequencies
---
# Example

For a typical warehouse environment

Worker (sober) falls off a ladder  

Risk = low severity but moderate frequency

Could be fatal, but low frequency, not negligible

Both should be considered in PHA

How can this risk be mitigated?

Maybe you have a separate section where fatalities are considered

How else could this be classified?
---
# Clearer comparisons can be made now
![Matrix](img/matrix.jpg)
---
![Farmer's chart](img/farmer.jpg)
---
# How can hazards be eliminated?

**Substitution**  
Use safe materials  
Simple hardware devices may be safer than using a computer
No technological imperative that says we MUST use computers to control dangerous devices  
Introducing new technology introduces unknowns and even unk−unks

**Simplify**  
Limit process states  
Easily understood and readable  
Interactions between components are limited and straightforward  
Code includes only minimum features and capability required by system  
No unnecessary, undocumented features, unused executable code  
Worst case timing is determinable  
Design so that structural decomposition matches functional decomposition
---
# How else can hazards be eliminated?

**Decouple**  
Tightly coupled system is one that is highly interdependent  
Failure or unplanned behavior in one can rapidly affect status of others  
System accidents caused by unplanned interactions  
Coupling creates increased number of interfaces and potential interactions

**Passive safeguards**  
Fail to a safe state

**Redundancy and diversity**

**Human error**
---
# In PHA, idea is to just rank the hazards and not to analyze each step in the procedure

Event can carry wide range of consequences from negligible to catastrophic 

Fire alone could be easy to put out or burn down the whole place

It would seen that an envelope of potential consequences would be sensible

Definitely worst case and maybe average consequence +/- something

Expert judgment is critical if there is a lack of data or experience 
---
# What's so good about PHA?

Helps ensure that the system is safe

Modifications are less expensive and easier to implement in earlier design stages  
This seems like the motivation for 'inventing' safeguardability (explain)

Decreases design time by reducing the number of surprises  
Identifies and provides a log of primary system hazards and corresponding risks

Provides systematic evaluation early enough to allow for design mitigation (Rokkasho)

Provides information to management to make decisions to allocate resources to reduce risk

Provides relatively quick review of most significant system risks
---
# What's not so good about PHA?

Hazards must be foreseen by the analysts  
Effects of interactions between hazards are not easily recognized  
You don't know what you don't know  
Especially for new systems like pyroprocessing

Can fail to assess risks well of combined hazards of common failure modes  
Then underrepresent overall system risk

Insufficient or inappropriate targets chosen, assessment is flawed

Garbage in = garbage out  
Wrong assumptions for unknown data, etc.

Too many targets, PHA becomes large and costly  
Which misses the point
