## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Preliminary hazards analysis

#### 3

# Learning outcomes

Chapter 6 in the book

Interpeting PHA within the context of risk assessment

Applying PHA to engineering problems and work environment

Develop a systematic approach to risk assessment
---
class: center,middle

# What is a hazard?
---
# Preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) is a semi-quantitative analysis tool

Line item tabular inventory of non trivial system hazards and countermeasures

Best applied in the design and development stage  
(early phase risk assessment tool)

Identify all potential hazards and intiating events that may lead to an accident

Rank the identified events according to their severity  
Can be drawn from the risk assessment matrix from before
---
# Identify required hazard controls and follow-up actions

Systematic process to identify hazards, prioritize, and propose mitigation

To produce a Preliminary Hazard List

Leading to deeper analytical tools
 
Rapid Risk Ranking  
Hazard identification (HAZID)  
Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)  
Hazard and operability review (HAZOP)  
Human error analysis (HEA)

## Identify the hazards in this office space - Where's the coverletters for the TPS reports?!

## Risk assessment is everyone's responsibility

## From OSHA's top 10 warehouse citations

1. Forklifts  
2. Hazard communication  
3. Electrical, wiring methods  
4. Electrical, system design  
5. Guarding floor, wall openings, holes  
6. Exits  
7. Mechanical power transmission  
8. Lockout, tagout  
9. Respiratory protection  
10. Portable fire extinguishers 

Any trends?

# [PHA is used as an initial risk study in the early stages of the project](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/preliminary-hazards-analysis/)

Initially developed by US Army  
"Army had half day, Mother!"

Used to review process areas of energy released in uncontrolled manner

Identify hazards and consequences  
Start as early as possible in system life cycle

Accidents are mainly caused by release of energy (table 6.3 in the book)  
chemical, electrical, mechanical
---
# Identify potential hazards where energy may be released  

mechanical moving parts  
material incompatibilities  
nuclear radiation  
electromagnetic radiation (laser, radio, UV, etc.)  
collisions from movement of personnel, equipment, automation

toxic materials and corrosive liquids, gases stored or generated  
all sorts of deterioration  
subsonic or supersonic noise  
biological, bacterial growth  
human error  
software, network, cyber-based 
---
# Identify accidental events (multiple) that may occur from each hazard 

Estimate frequency of hazards  
Estimate of the severity of each event  
We've done this, but stopped here  

Then  
Compare initial design concepts  
Focus on important risk issues  
Input for PRA   

You might be able to easily mitigate some events right at the start using PHA

Consider PHA to be the base level of risk analysis  
Not sufficient but a necessary start
---
# Adapt PHA to the system under study

Not everything is applicable to every system

Identify hazardous components or system elements

Facility related hazards and surrounding property

Interfaces between system elements related to safety (software)

Operational equipment  
Supporting equipment  
Safety equipment and related safeguards

Environmental constraints  
Operational constraints  
Leading to potential malfunctions to system and components
---
# Identify procedures related to operations, testing, maintenance, system diagnostics, emergencies

Obtain potential related data cohorts  
Reports, accident statistics, regulatory reviews if you know someone  
Or existing systems and PHAs  
Bring in some experts for an outside review

Model energy or material flow in the system and develop operational modes  
Review facility technical specifications if they are available  

Not so easy even though 'qualitative'
---
# PHA is most effectively used during the initial development of a process and the procedures for performing that process

In a PHA, idea is to list the hazards and not to analyze each step in the procedure  
Very top-level analysis, but when done properly, very useful for more comprehensive PRA

Would we really need this with mature systems?  
Like AP1000?
---
# Identify where each hazard will occur  

Significance   

Method to eliminate or mitigate   

How associated risk will be controlled
---
# Identify hazardous states of a system as part of the conceptual design phase

Something I can use in my own research

Establish framework  
input  
boundaries between the system(s)  
system interaction and dependencies  
system domain  
system functionality for each component and holistically  
layout  
process flow  
output
---
# Identify system hazards and materials

related accidents  

accident sequences  

energy use   
---
# Assign each accident a severity categorization

Quantify frequency of each accident sequence

Assign each hazard a preliminary random and systematic probability target  
6.1.1. in the book

Propose safety features needed during the design and development phase

You want to be able to head off low risk that can be mitigated by design and high risk that needs more work
