## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Failure modes and effects analysis

#### 4

## Learning outcomes

Chapter 9 in book

Explain and analyze failures for process, system, product in detail

My m/o is to use this time to show the concepts with my examples

See case studies and literature in the [OER](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-riskassessment/) to supplement the lecture

Choose what is most interesting and relevant to you

Immersive critical thinking - always the three questions

## It's really hard to quantify risk 

Who knew?!

PRA is a really really useful tool

It is the NRC regulatory paradigm

Still wasn't "invented" until there were 2-ish decades of operational data

Getting any data cohorts for an FMEA is ideal but probably difficult

If you have enough data, probably best to do a PRA in the first place or use this as a first run

Can use related historical or similarly accident data

What will I use for the injection casting process?
---
## Most likely will need to draw upon expert judgement and best estimates

Can use a [Delphi](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/failure-rates/) technique for this

Iterative way to develop consensus about something
---
class: center,middle

# What FMEA is
---
## FMEA helps to develop a firm understanding of what a failure is prior to risk analysis

Detailed document that identifies ways in which process/product fails
Or does not meet critical requirements

Inductive - Sherlock Holmes  
Bottom up, forward search approach [from chapter 3](https://thedoctorrab.github.io/class-lecture/tm529/3-preliminary-hazards-analysis/3-preliminary-hazards-analysis.html#39)

Living document that lists all the possible causes of failure  
Items can be generated to determine types of controls/changes in procedures 

Systematic way to identify and prevent problems in processes and products before they occur  
Design driven approach
---
## FMEA is a proactive tool to assist in new service design or enhancement of existing processes

What was the purpose of the PHA?

How will this relate?

FMEA might be more conducive when dealing with monetary loss

Most common for assessment technique at initial stages of system development

Maximize design life

class: center,middle

# FMEA definitions
---
## Let's start with some definitions

**Failure mode**  
Ways in which a process can fail  
Interrupts continuity of production  
Loss of assets (not just money)  
Unavailability of equipment  
Deviation from normal operation (define normal operation for pyroprocessing)  
Not meeting target expectations  
Secondary defects  

**Potential (failure) effect (consequence)**  
Result of failure mode   
Some more likely to occur than others  
Include regulatory requirements  
---
# More definitions

**Risk of failure**  
Each potential effect carries risk associated with it  
Consequences  
Frequency  

So we are still operating in the universe of the Three Questions

**Risk priority number**  
Value assigned to risk for each failure

class: center,middle

# Can results from a PHA be applied?
---
class: center,middle

# Utility of FMEA
---
## Why is FMEA effective?

Identify...

Areas of failure in process, system, component, or procedure  
Effects of the process, system, component, or procedure failing  
Failure causes (common cause)

Reducing the probability of failure  
Improving the means of detecting the causes of failure  
Risk ranking of failures, allowing risk informed decisions by those responsible 

A starting point from which the control plan can be created

Decomposition of risk - focus on the areas where risk can be reduced

# FMEA procedure
---
class: middle,center

# Flow chart
---
## Construct a detailed flow chart of the process

Multi-disciplinary participation of all those involved in the process

Allocate plenty of time for this step

Be as complete as possible

Flow charting software can help  
(or write your own)

The book uses an example of a lawn mower

Getting material into the crucible - effect - cause

Getting material into the crucible - effect - cause

Heater fails to sufficiently melt all the metal - effect - cause

Vacuum cannot be induced - effect - cause

Molds get stuck or break - effect - cause

Cannot remove heel - effect - cause

# Establish failure effects
---
## Determine the effects of each possible failure

**What are the consequences?**

Getting material into the crucible: crucible breaks

Heater fails to sufficiently melt all the metal: molds might crack; not sufficiently take up all the metal

Vacuum cannot be induced: no injection

Molds get stuck or break: big mess; liquid metal spills onto equipment

Cannot remove heel: replace crucible; store heel
---
class: center,middle

# Evaluate severity
---
## Apply a Severity Rating Scale

10 -Dangerously high -Injury  
9  -Extremely high   -Regulatory noncompliance  
8  -Very high        -Equipment inoperable or unfit for use  
7  -High             -High degree of customer dissatisfaction/bad results  
6  -Moderate         -Partial malfunction  
5  -Low              -Some performance loss  
4  -Very low         -Minor performance loss  
3  -Minor            -Identifiable product flaws  
2  -Very minor       -Not readily apparent product flaws  
1  -None

Or make one up

There's lots out there
---
## Assign severity rating to fuel fabrication failure modes

Getting material into the crucible: crucible breaks  
6 Moderate  
Failure results in subsystem or partial malfunction of the product

Heater fails to sufficiently melt all the metal: molds might crack; not sufficiently take up all the metal  
6 Moderate   
Failure results in subsystem or partial malfunction of the product

Vacuum cannot be induced: no injection  
6 Moderate  
Failure results in subsystem or partial malfunction of the product
---
## Assign severity rating to fuel fabrication failure modes

Molds get stuck or break: big mess; liquid metal spills onto equipment  
8 Very High   
Failure renders the unit inoperable or unfit for use

Cannot remove heel: replace crucible; store heel  
6 Moderate   
Failure results in subsystem or partial malfunction of the product

Any shutdown interrupts material flow

For pyroprocessing, we also would have to do a material balance and that takes time
---
class: center,middle

# Estimate failure frequency
---
## Estimate failure frequency with an Occurance Rating Scale

10 -Very high -1 per day or more than 3 per 10 events  
9  -Mid       -1 per 3,4 days or 3 per 10 events  
8  -High      -1 per week or 5 per 100 events  
7  -Mid       -1 per month or 1 per 100 events  
6  -Moderate  -1 per 3 months or 3 per 1000 events  
5  -Mid       -1 per 6 months or 1 per 10000 events  
4  -MidLow    -1 per year or 6 per 100000  
3  -Low       -1 per 1-3 years or 6 per 1 billion events  
2  -Mid       -1 per 3-5 years or 2 per 1 billion events  
1  -Remote    -1 per >5 years or less than 2 per 1 billion events

As long as it's a systematic scale

### We can see that this is a way to initially quantify risk based on unknown frequencies, etc.

# Root cause analysis

## Causes to make the metal stick to the crucible and cannot remove it cleanly

Graphite is the wrong material  
Inert atmosphere  
Can induce vacuum

Maybe there has to be X grams of it before removing  
We also have to be able to detect the material in the crucible

If the process is automated, it may be too complicated   
Human hands might be needed  
Which is a host of other problems
---
## Causes to make the metal stick to the crucible and cannot remove it cleanly

Different equipment might be needed instead of people  
So the removal process might need redesigning  
Or the removal process itself could use some optimization  
Maybe heat the crucible and pour metal into separate container

Should be conducted by a team and be more in depth
---
class: center,middle

# Mitigation
---
## Take action to eliminate or reduce the Risk Priority Number (RPN)

Decrease likelihood of occurrence

Decrease the severity of effects

Which either would reduce overall risk (go to RPN again)

Lab-scale testing of different crucible materials may show a preferable material  
May also show that removal cannot be achieved unless there is 100 grams, etc.

Probably have a lot of crucibles on hand and maybe develop a clean, swap out procedure  
Also induces cost hike

My expert opinion would be that the crucible is the primary root cause
---
## Apply a 'Plan-Do-Study-Act' approach

**What are we trying to accomplish?**  
Remove the heel without having it stick on the crucible  
We have to measure the SNM  
Then maybe store it and recycle it back into the melter

**How will we know that a change is an improvement?**  
Heel is removed cleanly  
Probably need to conduct lab scale experiments 

**What changes can we make that will result in an improvement?**  
See fishbone discussion  
Change material, procedures, environment  

Iterative process - but only so many meetings and brainstorming    
If you're the project manager, at some point you have to get the job done
