# TM529: Risk Assessment

## Objective

The objective of this course is to provide an understanding of risk assessment and related techniques for contemporary engineering problems.

## Overview 

This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of how to perform a comprehensive risk assessment applicable to a wide variety of engineering problems in many different disciplines. The course will focus on failure mode and effect analysis, fault tree analysis, probabilistic risk analysis, and human reliability analysis. The course will also cover fundamental probability and statistics content.

## [Code of student conduct](http://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/student-conduct/student-code-of-conduct)  

Realistically, much of professional engineering work is team-oriented. While it is ok to work in groups, students are expected to be familiar with the University of Idaho Student Code of Conduct.
