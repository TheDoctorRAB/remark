## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Fault and event trees

#### 5
---
# Learning outcomes

Chapter 8, 12, 14 in the book

Skipping decision trees in chapter 12 for later

Quanitifying risk using fault and event trees

Identifying where these tools fall short

Please remember to see [case studies](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/) in OER
---
# How likely is it to happen?

Fault and event trees require frequency analysis for initiating events

We need to establish frequencies for a PRA (chapter 8)

Data data data data data

Data doesn't magically appear, however

We've been talking about the pyroprocessing system

Troubles with scaling up from the laboratory experiments

Expert judgment only goes so far to where you're just making it up

Then any analysis is effectively meaningless
---
## Failure rate data is probably the most important

We need to know when equipment is going to fail for basically everything

As well as the probability distributions  
That allows for modeling and coding of the system first

We can also just buy equipment and test it  
Manufacturer might have the data

Though most entities outside of academics don't really have the time

There is a 30 year test bed for clay and radioactive waste in France  
At the repository site  
Because the repository is completely new and unprecedented 

We need to model behavior in the EDZ for at least 1000 years
---
# Some data can be obtained from the manufacturer

Historical data (e.g., MCNP error messages)

Government and military handbooks

[Reliability Information Analysis Center](https://www.qualitydigest.com/node/17750#)
---
# Failure rate of system or equipment varies over life cycle

We've shown the [bathtub curve](https://thedoctorrab.github.io/class-lecture/tm529/1-risk-overview/1-risk-overview.html#35) in Chapter 1

Airplanes (from the book is a good example)  
They're big, like a tylenol with wings!

[Failure Knowledge Database](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/fault-trees-2/)

Obviously the structure of the plane is going to degrade with time

High stress over the life cycle

[Table 8.2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11KeppAs0_VcJ_vLqMwpkflKbmLzNUPx13o_W31yFI8w/edit?usp=sharing) in the book is a typical example
---
### Sorting data into bins can present and overall picture of what is going on 

First, they sorted by [failure](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iNBowXJOa8Da4_TxbC0iFPxhtJtCSlNWTEF8rtCHdbI/edit?usp=sharing)  
I also sorted by [temperature and hours of operation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLsXFbCZcbv1Atahns1xxBUEvodaqZh2DdBCWs13oN4/edit?usp=sharing)

Any observations? 

**Failure rate**  
$\lambda = \frac{20}{130300}=1.53 \times 10^{-04}$ per hour

**Mean time before failure (MTBF)**  
$\theta = \frac{1}{\lambda} = 6515$ hours  
Typically called mean time to failure (MTTF)

Assumes all systems fail in the same way  
Is this the best way to do this?
---
# Let's look at failure as a function of temperature

**Above 100**  
$\lambda = 2.14 \times 10^{-04}$/h  
$\theta = 4675$h

**Below 100**  
$\lambda = 1.08 \times 10^{-04}$/h  
$\theta = 9275$h

Observations?

---
![Fuel fabrication](img/fuel.fabrication.jpg)
---
![Fuel fabrication process steps](img/fuel.fabrication.process.steps.jpg)
---
# For each process step, what are the failures?

Multiple failures, much more complexity

Getting material into the crucible  
Heater fails to sufficiently melt all the metal  
Vacuum cannot be induced  
Molds get stuck or break  
Cannot remove heel  

If one component fails the equipment fails

Systems do not fail in the same way

Major challenge to failure analysis
---
## It is important to consider how to frame failure data or what the data actually is

Space shuttle program used as an example 8.1.9  
At the time, failure rate was 1 in 25  
2 catastrophic failures in 132 flights currently however

Each shuttle operated for different number of missions with varying operating time (table 8.5)

Total of 30946 operating hours = 4.5 operating years  
1 failure in 15000 operating hours for 5 different shuttles  
There is not any normalization in terms of failures per operating year

Which is better?  
How to decide?
---
## Monte Carlo can be used to establish failure rates or MTTFs

Monte Carlo simulation is very famous, but not fancy

Generates values of a random variable based probability distributions

Applied to wide variety of complex problems involving random behavior

We use MCNP in nuclear engineering to simulate neutron behavior

Show example from NE450 now (lecture slides)
---
# Monte Carlo can be used for [reliability](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/failure-rates/)

$R(T) = e^{-(\frac{T}{\eta})^{\beta}}$

$U \equiv R(T)$ where U is a random number

$T = -\eta(lnU)^{\frac{1}{\beta}}$

What is the interpretation of T in this context?

When $\beta = 1$ we have the exponential distribution
---
![DES fuel fabrication](img/des_fuel.fabrication.jpg)
---
![Weibull](img/weibull.jpg)
---
![Unreliability](img/unreliability.jpg)
---
## We can use the unreliability function to simulate failures

$Q(t) = 1 - R(t)$

$Q(t) = 1 - e^{-(\frac{t}{\eta})^{\beta}}$

Assume $\beta = 1$ for general failures

$Q(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$  
$\lambda = 0.4$ per day

Monte Carlo simulates area under the curve at t = T

A 'hit' is an equipment failure
---
`campaign: 1`       
`operation time: 0.7144`  
`failure probability: 0.2486`  
`failure test: 0.1808`  
**`failure`**

New equipment is installed, so there is new distribution

`campaign: 2`       
`operation time: 3.0762`  
`failure probability: 0.2486`  
`failure test: 0.6888`  
**`no failure`**

Early times the likelihood of failure is low  
Later times it is higher because equipment is older
---
# Human error probability is difficult to quantify

Because people generally behave stupidly even sober

Or, different responses are elicited by people in the same environment

What would be examples of human errors that could be quantified?

Astronaut behavior in normal conditions and critical conditions

Psychological stress
---
## Performance shaping factors account for human response to stressors

hot/cold  
noise level   
light level (my office is dark)  
vibration  
ergonomics  
experience and training (this is something that can be changed)  
management  
time  
stress  
equipment design/human machine interface
---
# The [Delphi technique](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/failure-rates/) forecasts future events

Initially developed in the 1950s by Helmer and Dalkey at Rand Corp

Controlled opinion feedback

Initially â€œto solicit expert opinion to the selection, from the point of view of a Soviet strategic planner, of an optimal U.S. industrial target system and to the estimation of the number of A-bombs required to reduce the munitions output by a prescribed amount"
---
# Delphi is used to validate research outcomes

Impact analysis of changes to the international business environment

Identify national park selection criteria

Develop a taxonomy of organizational mechanisms

Develop rules for a ceramic casting process

Examine and explain how recruitment message specificity influences job seeker attraction to organizations

Well suited to rigorously capture qualitative data or when knowledge is incomplete
---
class: middle,center

# Let's step through an example
---
## Assemble a panel of experts and use the Delphi technique for your problem

**Mission - Build consensus with a panel on failure rates, etc.**  
Aircraft maintenance tasks - missing structural anomalies on an inspection (8.1.12)  
For composite structural material  
Relevance - Dreamliner 787 from ENGIN110

*Pyroprocessing (challenging because human interaction is limited)*  
*Robotic operation? Remote equipment operation?*

**Select panel and eliminate bias**  
Airline inspectors (regulations)  
Structural experts from manufacturer(s)  
Repair/mechanics experts
---
# Continuing 

**Select panel and eliminate bias**  
*People from INL*  
*Actual operators of injection casting equipment*

**Calibrate the panel on the topic**  
Historical data on detecting cracks in the structure (not the same but close)  
Inspection procedures, etc.    
In book example, estimated probabilities are presented

*Related data on industrial injection casting processing (crucible cracking)*
---
# Continuing

**Present the parameters of the task to evaluate**  
Qualitatively assess the problem  
Discuss any direct historical experience from inspectors, mechanics  
What kind of structural anomalies would be present?  

*How crucible has cracked, what can be applied to molten TRU*  
*How we can detect any cracking, range of crack lengths if you need a camera*

**Perform the initial round of discussions on the error probability**  
Detecting anomalies 2" or less  
Establish nominal probabilities for each class of crack 

**Discuss the results and iterate**  
**Repeat until consensus reached for each class**
---
# Continuing

**Develop PSFs**  
What factors would lower the probability of the task?  
Lack of training; experience  
Environmental conditions; lighting, etc.  
Time to inspect

*Hot cells; lack of direct line of sight*  
*Need for cameras?*  
*Highly radioactive environment* 

**Establish the conditions where the task can be achieved satisfactorily**  
"better than nothing"

For use in human reliability analysis

# Event tree analysis
---
### An event tree is a graphical representation of a series of possible events in an accident sequence

Each event is either a fail or success with associated frequency

Assumes events occur in sequence to a final state

Event sequences follow from some initial event of interest, usually a component failure

Downstream events follow from original event and subsequent events of other components

Initiating event -- event 1 -- event 2 -- event 3 -- event n-1 -- event n -- Final state

We covered ways to assess frequency

Now we're thinking about "What are the consequences?"
---
### What is the sequence of events when there is a [fire?](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/event-trees-2/) - Figure 12.2 in the book

![Event tree for fire](img/event.tree_fire.jpg)
---
# Calculate probabilities and losses
![Event tree for fire](img/event.tree_fire.loss.jpg)
---
![Event tree for pump and valve maintenance](img/event.tree_pump.valve.jpg)
---
![Event tree for high pressure gas](img/event.tree_gas.jpg)
---
# Event trees apply forward logic

We start with the initiating events and work to what eventually happens

Event trees are used to describe the major events in the accident sequence and each event can then be further analyzed using a fault tree

Each event would need its own fault tree

Event trees are accident sequence development tools

We talked about WASH1400 that basically invented for nuclear power plants

[NRC Handbook](http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr0492/)

Figure 12.3 in the book
---
![Event tree for LOCA](img/event.tree_loca.jpg)
---
# Multiple barriers reduce risk

A well designed system has multiple barriers that are implemented to stop or reduce consequences of events

The probability that an accidental event will lead to unwanted consequences will therefore depend on whether these barriers are functioning

Event trees can then also be used as a design tool

Design, procedural weaknesses can be identified
---
# Event trees are essential to a PRA

Visualize event chains following an accidental event

Visualize barriers and sequence of activation

Good basis for evaluating the need for new/improved procedures and safety functions

Draws on prior PHAs, etc., to determine initiating events

So it's a natural progression into PRA I,II,III
---
# But event trees have limitations

No standard for the graphical representation of the event tree

Only one initiating event can be studied in each analysis

Easy to overlook subtle system dependencies

Not well suited for handling common cause failures (only independent events)

Practical only when events can be ordered in time (chronology of events is stable) 

Does not show acts of omission

Difficult to represent interactions among events  
Difficult to consider effects of multiple initiating events (PHA, FMEA)

So we need other tools for comprehensive risk assessment
---
class: center,middle

# Fault tree analysis
---
### Fault tree analysis is applied to identify areas to mitigate or prevent risk at all phases of system life cycle

'Little things' lead to catastrophic failures  
Like the [Japan Airlines](http://lessonslearned.faa.gov/ll_main.cfm?TabID=4&LLID=16&LLTypeID=2) accident  

But before risk assessment was invented, most likely from common cause failures

Advancements in technologies increased complexity and necessitated detailed safety analysis

First FTA developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories (1962)

For the Minuteman ICBM (can't find any information)

Though it seems that not formalized as part of risk assessment until WASH1400
---
### Fault trees are a graphic to represent the interaction of failures and other events in a system

Top down, deductive failure analysis  
Top event are hazards or failure modes (from event tree)  
Decompose the top event using boolean logic (AND, OR)  
Bottom set of events are non-decomposable (basic events)

Top events are LOCA, emissions, explosions

Identify failures as a malfunction in a component requiring repair (pump shaft)

Identify faults as malfunctions that self-repair once the governing condition is corrected (wet contacts for a switch; dry them)

Undeveloped events are neglected due to low probability or effect on system

FMEA can be used as input to FTA
---
## Define the top event clearly and unambiguously

What is the event?  
Where does the event occur?  
When does the event occur?

Crucible cracks in the injection casting equipment during normal operation

Immediate, necessary, and sufficient causes leading to the event  
Connect via logic gates (down)

Get down to basic events  
Independent events  
For which failure data is obtained (or distributions)  
Work back up to compute top event probability

Really requires expert knowledge of the system
---
# Assemble a basic event matrix after defining the top event

Basic failure event -- description -- credible? (table 14.5)

Assessing credibility = whether to include the event in the fault tree

Coolant system flushing procedure in the car (14.7.1)

Sprinkler system failure

System design tool
---
### [TAM Airlines Flight 3054](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sao+Paulo+International+Airport/@-23.4382049,-46.4703261,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x94ce8af96f722a25:0x8071626c51a7154a!8m2!3d-23.4345529!4d-46.478126) overran the runway and crashed into a warehouse (2007)

Use of FTA for accident analysis with multiple failures (14.7.3)

Airplane are an instructive example because we know a lot about them

Warehouse next to gas station, which exploded

199 fatalities
---
# What happened

Rain caused the runway to be wet

Plane overran the runway

Crossed the road(!)
---
# Background

20379 operating hours

Jammed braking device reported the day before (thrust reverser)

Landed and couldn't slow down

Veered left and overshot runway over the major road

Collided with warehouse

Safety issues with insufficient length of the runway (faster speed, more distance to stop)
---
# Flight recorder

Thrusters in climb position just before touchdown

Audio warning 2 seconds before touchdown for pilots to take manual control

One idle, one at climb position at touchdown; both needed to be in idle position

(cause of veering left)

So, what are some causes for this crash?
---
![Sao Paulo airport](img/brazil_airport.jpg)
---
# Top event is the airplane crash

So, what are some causes for this crash?  
Wet runway (hydroplaning, loss of vehicle control)  
Rain   
Grooves cut in runway to drain and increase traction  
Thrust reverser broken (known)  
Airline policy allowed aircraft to be flown with broken thrust reverser  
Short runway   
Airport policy allowed larger planes to land on runway  
Experienced pilots had not had training in this situation  

Which of these are basic events?
