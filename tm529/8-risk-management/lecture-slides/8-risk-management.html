## What is risk management?
---
## Risk management is a formalized means of developing, selecting, and managing options for addressing risks

[Project Management Institute Body of Knowledge](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok) gives three definitions of risk management

Formal process by which risk factors are systematically identified, assessed, and provided for

Formal, systematic method of managing that concentrates on identifying and controlling areas or events that have a potential for causing unwanted change 

Art and science of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk factors throughout the life of a project and in the best interest of its objectives 

How do we feel about these?
---
class: center,middle

# Strategies
---
## There are several strategies to manage risk

Transfer risk to another party

Avoid risk

Reduce frequency 

Reduce consequences a particular event

Regulations provide acceptable level of risk

# Net present value
---
## Net present value is an important criterion for management

What is the relationship between 1 dollar today and 1 dollar tomorrow?

Cost is typically the motivating factor in selecting options

Not always the best though

Expenditures and revenues occur over life cycle

For NPPs much of the expenditures are up front but big

NPV measures present value of various cash flows in different periods in the future
---
## Rate at which future cash flows are discounted is determined by the discount rate

You want $NPV > 0$

Wealth maximization principle

Maximize the current value of the investors net wealth

Shareholders in an energy company to build a new reactor

Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs

Current discount rates contained in [OMB Circular A-94, Appendix C](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/12/23/2019-27575/discount-rates-for-cost-effectiveness-analysis-of-federal-programs)

---
class:center,middle

![Blank decision tree](img/decision.tree_blank.jpg)
---
## How many decisions with complete certainty have you ever made?

All decisions carry risk

You're making decisions with imperfect knowledge  
Does a good decision always guarantee a good outcome?

Almost all decisions involve some level of uncertainty  

Consequences may be large or insignificant  
Use of a decision tree can aid in strategic thinking

Decision making with uncertainty  
Quantitative reasoning

[Frank Knight (1921)](https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/knight-risk-uncertainty-and-profit) famed text on the topic
---
class: center,middle

# Example
---
## What's your decision?

Win 100 dollars calling the roll of a die even or odd

35 dollar buy in

I can afford to lose 35 dollars  
I could really use 100 dollars  
I need to ask Panda  
I don’t gamble
---
## Is 35 dollars a good buy in?  

What would you negotiate?

Decision analysis forces you to think carefully   

True nature of the decision problem by constructing a tree

Nature of the sequential interaction of decisions and chance events

Can only choose opportunities (pathways) not outcomes

The outcomes are what they are 
---
## How do we evaluate a decision?

Decide on the decision criterion - is it money (loss or gain)?  
Fatalities? Accidents? Dose? 

Decide on a model to evaluate the criteria  
Expected value  
Utility theory

_Certainty Equivalent_ is when you are indifferent between a deal with at least two opportunities and a guaranteed sum of money

Risk tolerance is on either side of that 

Ideally you would want to know the outcome beforehand

That is why you count cards
---
## Distinguish between good decisions and good outcomes

Good decisions balance good and bad outcomes in accordance with risk attitudes

**Heterogeneity**  
Range of different outcomes  
How bad is bad  
How much worse is one than the other

**Relating Probabilities to Probabilities**  
Small probabilities  
Intuitive tendencies aren't typically correct

**Complexity**  
Multiple outcomes and multiple probabilities
---
## Risk aversion is a psychological concept to settle for a lower return for a greater certainty of outcomes

People are not indifferent to uncertainty  
Stems from uneven preferences for different outcomes

Decreased chance of losing money

I don't like losing 100 dollars for the chance to gain 250 dollars

I would rather try to gain 500 dollars even if I could lose 150 dollars

Risk averse individuals will pay risk premiums to avoid uncertainty - fear loss and seek sureness

Buy the half a point on a 7.5 line in football
---
## Risk neutral are indifferent to uncertainty

Expected value criterion is useful generally in the case where the decision maker is risk neutral

Utility theory offers an alternative to the expected value approach
---
## Risk lovers hope to win big and don’t mind losing as much

Risk lover seeks to maximize the maximum gain - maximax

Conservative decision maker seeks to maximize the minimum gain or minimize the maximum loss - maximin minimax
---
## How is this done? 

Choose between a fixed sum of money k and lottery in which the expected prize is k, you are indifferent

Risk averse takes the fixed sum

Risk seeker takes the lottery

Get 100 dollars up front, or go for the lottery where the coin flip gives you 200 dollars on heads

Expected value is not a good criterion for people who dislike risk
---
## A risk premium is the amount paid by a (risk averse) individual to avoid risk

Insurance premiums

Higher fees paid by owner to reputable contractors

Higher charges by contractor for risky work

Lower returns from less risky investments

Warranty?

# Bridge modifications

![Bridge modification scenario](img/bridge.mods.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

# Upfront costs
---
## What is the best decision for bridge modifications?

Maximize the minimum gain

Minimize the maximum loss

Maximize the maximum gain

'Do nothing' decision must be included 

30M cost to repair

50M cost to replace

Different losses based on the scenario and decision made

# Expected value
---
class: center,middle

![Bridge modification expected value](img/bridge.mods.expected.jpg)
---
## How does the use of expected value affect decision making?

The do nothing option has the largest loss

Going just by expected loss replacing the bridge is the best option

Are there other factors affecting the decision besides money? 

What other metrics could be used?

For more complicated analysis, Bayes theory is often applied

# Hurwicz criterion
---
## Hurwicz criterion models a range of decision-making attitudes from conservative to optimistic

### $v(a_i,s_j) \equiv payoff$

### $Max(\alpha \: max \: v(a_i,s_j)+(1-\alpha) \: min \: v(a_i,s_j))$

$\alpha = 0$ = minimax; risk averse

$\alpha = 1$ = maximax; risk seeking

Maximize by taking the derivative and finding the optimality index and measure risk aversion

# Land use
---
class: center,middle

![Land use template](img/land.use.template.jpg)
---
## How can we determine the best option for land use? 

I did not include the do nothing option because I assumed doing nothing would result in zero for all scenarios, but more detailed analysis might be useful

### $M(a_1)=60 \alpha-20(1-\alpha)$
### $M(a_2)=50 \alpha-0(1-\alpha)$
### $M(a_3)=100 \alpha-50(1-\alpha)$
### $M(a_4)=15 \alpha-10(1-\alpha)$

## [Utility theory](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-riskassessment/chapter/utility-theory/)
---
## Uncertain prospects are worth less in utility terms than certain ones, even when expected tangible payoffs are the same

Flip a coin    
heads = 10M  
tails = -9M  

E(G) = 0.5M

So it's a high expected payoff - no way you play the game though
---
## Flip a coin and get $2^n$ for every tails in a row  

How much would you pay to buy in?  

E(1 flip) = 1 dollar    
E(2 flip) = 2 dollars    
E(G) = infinite  

[St. Petersburg paradox](https://policonomics.com/saint-petersburg-paradox/)

We want to be able to measure these preferences with sound models

Utility functions translate outcomes ($) into pure numbers to calculate certainty equivalents consistent with a decision maker's attitude toward risk taking

Utility of a consequence is a quantification of a person's relative preference for that consequence
---
class: center,middle

![Utility function example](img/utility.function.example.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

# Expected utility
---
## Utility theory can give a measure of your buy in

Consider a coin flip for a 2 dollar prize  
Use expected utility instead of expected value

### $E(u) = 0.5 \: u(0) + 0.5 \: u(2)$

### $u(x)=x \rightarrow E(u) = 1$

### $u(x)=x^2 \rightarrow E(u) = 2$

### $u(x)=\sqrt{x} \rightarrow E(u) = 0.71$

Expected utility for risk seeker is higher
---
## Take the inverse of the utilities to determine your buy in

### $f(E(u)) \equiv u^{-1}$

### $f(1)= 1$

### $f(2)= 1.41$

### $f(0.71)= 0.50$

Buy in is based on level of personal risk
---
class: center,middle

# Data fitting
---
## Derive a utility function by data fit to determine risk level

### $\pi (x) \equiv a \: u(x) + b$

### $0 \leq \pi \leq 1$

### $a>0$

# Arrow-Pratt coefficient
---
## The [Arrow-Pratt coefficient](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~rek8/econ604/lecturenotes/topic2notesparttwo.pdf) measures risk aversion

### $r_A(x) \equiv -\frac{u''(x)}{u'(x)}$

### $u(x)=x^2 \rightarrow r_A(x) = -\frac{1}{x}$

### $u(x)=\sqrt{x} \rightarrow r_A(x) = \frac{1}{2x}$

### $u(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x} \rightarrow r_A(x) = \lambda$

Who is the most risk averse?
---
## What is risk aversion like as wealth increases?

$r_A$ is positive for risk averse individuals

Measure of curvature of preference scaling function

Certainty equivalent is less for the more curved function

Square root, Weibull, power law, ln(x) are common risk averse utility functions

The higher ARA, the more favorable odds the investor will demand in order to be willing to accept the risky bet
---
class: center,middle

# Multiple attributes
---
## What happens when you have to measure utility for multiple attributes?

$u(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n)$  
Previously we have been trying to find the utility of wealth  
What else would we want to characterize in terms of utility?

Assumes independence of attributes (preferences) and linearity 

Postulate assumptions about the preference attitudes of the decision maker

# Analytic hierarchy process
---
## AHP is a multiattribute decision analysis method that uses subjective judgments

[Saaty T L](http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/meetings/mathofranking/ref/saaty1.pdf) (1980)   
[The Analytic Hierarchy Process](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=saaty+the+analytic+hierarchy+process&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart), McGraw Hill International

Alternate approach to expected utility  
Really good for multi criteria

Identify goal  
Establish criteria affecting goal  
Derive factors affecting each criteria  
Generate alternatives
---
class: center,middle

# Procedure
---
## Make pairwise comparisons with alternatives under each criteria

Make a relative assessment between two items at a time (only 2)  
Use objective information if possible

1: elements are equally important  
3: one element is weakly more important  
5: one element is strongly more important  
7: one element is demonstrably important  
9: one element is absolutely more important

Values of 2,4,6,8 are compromises between defined categories

Then arrange values into a matrix
---
## AHP is a fairly qualitative and kind of an expert judgment 

Derive consistency ratio less than 0.100

AHP does not require perfect consistency  
Provides a measure of consistency

Develop weights based on criteria and score each alternative

Saaty suggests that hierarchies be limited to six levels and nine items per level.  

Psychological result that people can consider 7 +/- 2 items simultaneously

You can actually compare apples and oranges so tell people to shut up when they say that

# TSPA
---
class: center,middle

![AHP first try](img/ahp_first.try.jpg)
---
## This first try was overly complicated

Goal - recommendation to DOE

Criteria - environmental impact and public perception

Under environmental impact I put EPA, NRC compliance with the TSPA

**Alternatives**  
Delay - delay to accept and construct  
No action - do nothing  
Construct - start to construct  
Alt. Tech. - alternative technologies (didn't consider dry cask at the time)  
Diff. site - start over with a different site  
Modify - modify YM design (drip shield, backfill)
---
## Five criteria and six alternatives is a lot of pairwise comparisons

Simplify this diagram  
Could lead to high inconsistency  

**No action 1**  
Onsite storage under institutional control for 10000 y

**No action 2**  
Onsite storage under institutional control for 100 y

Combine delay and modify so they can modify existing design while delaying shipments

In hindsight, with dry cask storage, this would change a lot
---
## Public perception is weakly more important than environmental impact

## Find *normalized* eigenvector for greatest eigenvalue (real valued)

Eigenvalue should be slightly > n

python of course (one line of code) but plenty of online tools 

There are n eigenvalues/vectors for an n x n matrix

Because the judgment cannot be truly consistent, we assume it exhibits a small perturbation and can satisfy the eigenvalue equation

Measure consistency to prove this

Deviation should only be small

## Risk perception and communication
---
## Effective communication of risk involves understanding risk perception

“What we had done to these people was just outrageous. We had frightened them so bad, they thought they were going to die.”  

NRC official describing government communication during TMI

Public perceives and responds to risky situations based on emotion in addition to facts (which is fine)

Sabine Roeser is the expert in the role of emotion and risk  
Emotion is a rational process
---
## Nuclear risk is the most difficult risks and nuclear experts have to be the most socially literate

"Emotion can play a bigger role in the way people perceive risks, than reason and rational thinking"

Paul Slovic - Affect heuristic

Emerging technologies exhibit a different paradigm and require different approaches

I don't like use of "the public" because it frames a us v them mentality

Aren't we all the public?
---
## Nuclear engineering is unique because of 'historical inertia'

August 1964 New York Times Magazine:

Einstein  

“The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything except our modes of thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophes. We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive.
---
Marshall Shepherd, 2013 President American Meteorological Society and NASA  

"Consensus is tricky. Disagreement has always been a part of science. However, I find now that in the era of 'armchair' science - many people just don't understand the scientific process, the peer-review process, etc. They see thing more like a legal system and reasonable doubt. If there is reasonable doubt or slight uncertainty, they think the basic scientific premise is flawed. Science doesn't work that way."

Complaining about it isn't fixing it
---
## Nuclear and radiological risks feel more frightening to the public

If they don't feel "safe" then they aren't safe so it doesn't matter what the facts are

"These characteristics must be acknowledged in order to effectively manage public behavior"

Ridiculously arrogant and could not be more wrong

This is an example of coercion and flat out unethical

Meet them where they are

What is important to others may not be what you think it is
---
## What affects risk perception?

Media attention (this is an excuse)  
Familiarity   
Scientific certainty    
History / Stigma    
Reversibility  
Trust   
Benefits  
Fairness of risk distribution  
Nature of risk  
Catastrophic potential v chronic (low probability/high consequence - high probability/low consequence)  
Uncertainty  
Fear  
Influence on children and future generations  
---
## What affects risk perception?

Voluntary v involuntary risk

Driving a car v flying even though flying is lower risk

Again, which is the problem with nuclear

Anything to add?

"The risk manager must […] deal not only with risk perceived through science, but also with virtual risk - risks where the science is inconclusive and people are thus liberated to argue from, and act upon, preestablished beliefs, convictions, prejudices and superstitions."
---
## Establishing trust is the primary factor in effective communication

Admit when mistakes have been made  
Avoid secrets

Dialogue and respect for audience feelings must be sincere

Veracity = sincere + honest  
Need both

"Oh, I'm just being honest." "No, you're being a bag."

Do not tell people how they should feel  
That makes me feel angry!

Do not over reassure either though
---
## CDC recommends preparing for the following risk questions when dealing with the public

Why did this happen?

Why wasn’t this prevented?

What else can go wrong?

When were you notified about this?

What does this information mean?

How are ill going to get help?

What can we expect?

What bad things aren’t you telling us?
---
![Risk chart](img/risk.chart.jpg)
---
## No single level of risk that society finds acceptable

This is why there are regulations, but people may not accept that either

Risks that society is prepared to accept or tolerate will vary from situation to situation

Localities v Las Vegas for Yucca Mountain  
Just about every waste repository case was a failure in communication  
Japanese case  
South Korea  

Community needs to be involved (Finland, Sweden)

Long time scales, irreversibility, complexity hard to communicate
---
## Learning how to talk to people isn't so easy

Talk local and personal

Talk about concrete facts and issues, not abstract

Talk about what is happening now, not later  
(We can solve this problem now with our current engineering and technology)

Emphasize trade offs with risks and benefits

Talk about increasing consequences if delaying and doing nothing

Talk about manageable solutions

Meet people where they are

Social scientists are critically important
---
## EPA has seven cardinal rules of risk communication

Accept and involve the public as a legitimate partner

Listen to the audience  
(Meet people where they are)

Be honest, frank, and open  
(Veracity)

Coordinate and collaborate with other credible sources

Meet the needs of the media

Speak clearly and with compassion

Plan carefully and evaluate performance
