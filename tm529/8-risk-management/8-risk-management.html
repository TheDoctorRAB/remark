## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Risk management

## Learning outcomes

Demonstrating basic risk management concepts 

Applying risk management to common problems 

Analyzing outcomes that effectively manage or mitigate risk

Assessing risk level in terms of tolerance or preference

Choosing the appropriate management options

## What is risk management?
---
### Risk management is a formalized means of developing, selecting, and managing options for addressing risks

[Project Management Institute Body of Knowledge](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok) gives three definitions of risk management

Formal process by which risk factors are systematically identified, assessed, and provided for

Formal, systematic method of managing that concentrates on identifying and controlling areas or events that have a potential for causing unwanted change 

Art and science of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk factors throughout the life of a project and in the best interest of its objectives 

How do we feel about these?
---
## There are several strategies to manage risk

Transfer risk to another party

Avoid risk

Reduce frequency 

Reduce consequences a particular event

Regulations provide acceptable level of risk

## Net present value is an important criterion for management

What is the relationship between 1 dollar today and 1 dollar tomorrow?

Cost is typically the motivating factor in selecting options

Not always the best though

Expenditures and revenues occur over life cycle

For NPPs much of the expenditures are up front but big

NPV measures present value of various cash flows in different periods in the future
---
## Rate at which future cash flows are discounted is determined by the discount rate

You want NPV > 0

Wealth maximization principle

Maximize the current value of the investors net wealth

Shareholders in an energy company to build a new reactor

Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs

Current discount rates contained in [OMB Circular A-94, Appendix C](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a094/a94_appx-c)

Must consider all relevant cash flows throughout the decision life cycle

## Decision trees
---
## How many decisions with complete certainty have you ever made?

All decisions carry risk, like my first marriage

You're making decisions with imperfect knowledge  
Does a good decision always guarantee a good outcome?

Almost all decisions involve some level of uncertainty  

Consequences may be large or insignificant  
Use of a decision tree can aid in strategic thinking

Decision making with uncertainty  
Quantitative reasoning

[Frank Knight (1921)](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Risk,%20Uncertainty,%20and%20Profit_4.pdf) famed text on the topic
---
## What's your decision?

Win 100 dollars calling the roll of a die even or odd

35 dollar buy in

I can afford to lose 35 dollars  
I could really use 100 dollars  
I need to ask Panda  
I don’t gamble
---
## Is 35 dollars a good buy in?  

What would you negotiate?

Decision analysis forces you to think carefully   

True nature of the decision problem by constructing a tree

Nature of the sequential interaction of decisions and chance events

Can only choose opportunities (pathways) not outcomes

The outcomes are what they are 
---
## How do we evaluate a decision?

Decide on the decision criterion - is it money (loss or gain)?  
Fatalities? Accidents? Dose? 

Decide on a model to evaluate the criteria  
Expected value  
Utility theory

Certainty Equivalent is when you are indifferent between a deal with at least two opportunities and a guaranteed sum of money

Risk tolerance is on either side of that 

Ideally you would want to know the outcome beforehand

That is why you count cards
---
## Distinguish between good decisions and good outcomes

Good decisions balance good and bad outcomes in accordance with risk attitudes

**Heterogeneity**  
Range of different outcomes  
How bad is bad  
How much worse is one than the other

**Relating Probabilities to Probabilities**  
Small probabilities  
Intuitive tendencies aren't typically correct

**Complexity**  
Multiple outcomes and multiple probabilities

---
### Risk aversion is a psychological concept describing how we settle for a lower return in exchange for a greater certainty of outcomes

People are not indifferent to uncertainty

Stems from uneven preferences for different outcomes

Decreased chance of losing money

I don't like losing 100 dollars for the chance to gain 250 dollars

I would rather try to gain 500 dollars even if I could lose 150 dollars

Risk averse individuals will pay risk premiums to avoid uncertainty - fear loss and seek sureness

Buy the half a point on a 7.5 line in football
---
## Risk neutral are indifferent to uncertainty

Expected value criterion is useful generally in the case where the decision maker is risk neutral

Utility theory offers an alternative to the expected value approach
---
## Risk lovers hope to win big and don’t mind losing as much

Risk lover seeks to maximize the maximum gain - maximax

Conservative decision maker seeks to maximize the minimum gain or minimize the maximum loss - maximin minimax
---
## How is this done? 

Choose between a fixed sum of money k and lottery in which the expected prize is k, you are indifferent

Risk averse takes the fixed sum

Risk seeker takes the lottery

Get 100 dollars up front, or go for the lottery where the coin flip gives you 200 dollars on heads

Expected value is not a good criterion for people who dislike risk
---
## A risk premium is the amount paid by a (risk averse) individual to avoid risk

Insurance premiums

Higher fees paid by owner to reputable contractors

Higher charges by contractor for risky work

Lower returns from less risky investments

Warranty?
