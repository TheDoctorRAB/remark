## RISK ASSESSMENT
### HRA and HAZOP

# Learning outcomes

Chapter 10

Applying HRA and HAZOP

Analyzing systems peformance 

Assessing human reliability as part of risk

HAZOP is not in the book

See [OER](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/) for information on HAZOP

# Human reliability analysis
---
# HRA is typically part of PRA

Based on human error probability

Different from the other tools so introduced here

PRA --> equipment failure

HRA --> analyze people response to equipment failure

Though an initiating event in PRA could be due to people

HRA can identify activities where human error can be reduced

HRA supports PRA
---
### HRA "system" is series of steps or actions that involve the potential for human failure

Pump trips in a reactor facility

Personnel would start the other pump and then maybe untrip the first one

PRA tells us the sequence resulting in the trip with an event tree maybe

HRA tell us how the personnel would screw up fixing it

What would be the best way to reduce probability of human error?

[Dreamliner documentary](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/contemporary-cases-in-risk-assessment-2/) talking about where to score drugs
---
## LOCA is the worst accident at the reactor

Initiating event: rupture in coolant pipes (10.1.3)  
How could that happen?

pipe ruptures (somewhere)

drywell pressure reaches 2 psig  
(provides pressure suppression system and fission product barrier BWR)

emergency core cooling system (ECCS) initiates 

reactor SCRAM signal initiates   
containment building isolates  
emergency ventilation systems start

Probably could construct and event tree since these are all success/fail
---
## Operators have a bunch to do if a LOCA occurs

Verify ECCS initiates  
SCRAM actions

Verify containment isolation  
Verify emergency ventilation starts

Numerous manual actions all with potential for error  
Passive safety therefore is a big deal at reactors

AP1000 has numerous passive safety upgrades from Generation III designs

Famous EBR-II experiment
---
## Operators have to act if automatic systems fails

Like turning on the emergency ventilation systems

For loss of onsite power, which would kill the pumps, someone may have to start generators

Which was hard to do at Fukushima because they were flooded

Even though these are fairly straightforward procedures there is a lot happening quickly with personnel

Which leads to error

As much passive safety as there can be, human action is always going to be required at some level
---
### Each HRA must be 'bounded' and have measurable start and end states

Start point and metric for successful completion of each step is distinctly identified 

For SCRAM actions
1. Control rods inserted into core (automatic no human action) 
2. Operator places reactor mode switch to shutdown position 
3. Verify all control rods fully inserted
4. Verify reactor power is decreasing
5. Operator inserts low power level monitors
6. Verify reactor vessel (coolant) level to be within the correct band 
7. Verify reactor pressure to be within the correct band
8. Verify reactor coolant pumps shift to slow speed
9. Shift feed water control system to single element
---
# You need an HRA for each step 

Then assess total human failure probability for SCRAM

Same procedure for each event in the pipe rupture sequence

Then obtain failure probability of LOCA

All of this will be defined as an accident sequence in a PRA
---
### 'Task analysis' identifies personnel actions into basic steps

Derive the smallest set of actions (very detailed)  
Walk through the overall procedure and list what needs to be done  

Include what to do if personnel fails to achieve each step in the procedure  

10.2 in the book shows how to do this for "verifying all rods are inserted" (coming up next)

It seems overly much, but you need all this precise actions to get operating license

Walkthrough with experienced personnel 

You don't want to be "umm, what's first now" when an accident happens (muscle memory)
---
### "User error" for a nuclear reactor accident has enormous social implications

TMI and Chernobyl

We had all this on our research reactor, but there was only one big button
---

# Task analysis - Figure 10.1

Operators must validate the sequence

All the stuff to do in one NPP

Why do we need to be so detailed?

What would cause a failure?
---

---
![WPI 2](img/wpi.reactor2.jpg)
---
### HRA model visually depicts each task as a failure with applicable recovery actions

HRA model needs to visually depict each task as a failure with applicable recovery actions

Potential human errors and their mechanisms

Recovery paths if error occurs

Quantify error (frequency)

What would be the errors and recovery acts for the SCRAM rods sequence? 

Could make an event tree or fault tree from this

Though fault tree would be just one and gate (figure 10.3) for failure to verify rod insertion
---
## Human error probability is difficult to quantify

Different responses are elicited by people in the same environment  

What would be examples of human errors that could be quantified?

Astronaut behavior in normal conditions and critical conditions  

Psychological stress
---
### Performance shaping factors account for human response to stressors

hot/cold  
noise level  
light level (my office is dark)  
vibration  
ergonomics  
experience and training (this is something that can be changed)  
management  
time  
stress  
equipment design/human machine interface

Now, getting into an HRA, we need to obtain real frequencies to put together a PRA
