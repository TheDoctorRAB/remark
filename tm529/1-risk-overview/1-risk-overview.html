## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Risk assessment and management overview

#### 1
---
# Learning outcomes

Understanding risk, analysis, and management

What risk analysis is used for/how it is done

Think critically about risk analysis and how to use them (social implications)

This was my first class at Berkeley (piazza)

Prof. W. E. Kastenberg, one of the pioneers in the field

Originally a main component at Diablo Valley College
I tend to jump around so tell me to stop to clarify

Chapters 1 - 3 in the book

This is a little all over the place but roll with it - that's most of the course

# What is risk?
---
# Risk is the possibility of loss

A dangerous factor  
Person or thing that is a specified hazard  

Hazard = Existing or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death; damage to, or loss of equipment and property; or degradation of the mission

Hazard identification  
Human studies  
Animal studies  
Cell/tissue studies  
Exposure surveys  
---
# Risk is the probability of an event multiplied by its consequences

Exposure to injury or loss

Risk level is expressed in terms of hazard probability and severity

Probability = Frequency that an event will occur

Severity = Expected result of an event (degree of injury, property damage or other mission impairing factors)

Exposure = frequency and length of time soldiers, equipment, and missions are subjected to a hazard

Controls = actions taken to eliminate or reduce the risks identified
---
# Then ‘safe’ means free from risk

Secure from threat of danger, harm or loss

Affording safety from danger

So can you really say anything is safe?

Should the engineer say something is safe?

Like a car, reactor, plane, space shuttle

What can you do?
---
# Risk assessment is the identification of hazards

Characterization of an individual hazard or all identified hazards combined to complete a task

Residual risk = level of risk remaining after controls have been implemented

Controls are altered until the residual risk is at an acceptable level or until it cannot practically be further reduced

Multiple hazards have varying residual risk

Kind of like ALARA in nuclear engineering problems 
---
# Risk analysis has been used primarily as a retrospective process

Developed by the US Space Program in 50s and 60s  
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to both correct missile and rocket failures

Reactor Safety Study [WASH-1400](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/pra-2/)  
Only after ~75 NPPs designed, built, operating in USA  
First real PRA analysis

Risk management came to prominence after TMI in 1979 

Limited number of plant specific PRAs  
[Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. Nuclear Power Plants](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1150/)  
First Level III full scope PRA  
---
# Level III assessments now done all the time to obtain operating license   

NRC paradigm now “Risk-Informed Decision Making” 
Risk assessment as one input into design and operational changes 

Deterministic and reductionistic

Highly dependent on detailed system analysis

Data driven and now big big data is a big big thing 

Unless you have no operational data cohorts like for pyroprocessing
---
# There are two types of risk

**Tactical/Mission risk** concerned with hazards that exist because of the presence of enemy or adversary  
(physical protection)

It applies to all levels of and across the spectrum of operations

**Accident risk** includes all operational risk considerations otherwise  
Risks posed to populace by an operation, as well as an operations impact on the environment

Activities associated with hazards concerning personnel, civilians, equipment readiness, and environmental conditions
---
class: center,middle

# Severity classified by varying degrees
---
## CATASTROPHIC (I)
Loss of ability to accomplish the mission or mission failure

Death or permanent total disability (accident risk)

Loss of major or mission-critical system or equipment

Major property ( facility) damage

Severe environmental damage

Mission-critical security failure 

Unacceptable collateral damage
---
## CRITICAL (II) 

Significantly (severely) degraded mission capability or unit readiness

Permanent partial disability, temporary total disability exceeding 3 months time (accident risk)

Extensive (major) damage to equipment or systems

Significant damage to property or the environment

Security failure

Significant collateral damage
---
## MARGINAL (III)  
Degraded mission capability or unit readiness

Minor damage to equipment or systems, property, or the environment

Lost day due to injury or illness not exceeding 3 months (accident risk)

Minor damage to property or the environment
---
## NEGLIGIBLE (IV)

Little or no adverse impact on mission capability

First aid or minor medical treatment (accident risk)

Slight equipment or system damage, but fully functional and serviceable

Little or no property or environmental damage
---

---
# Any engineering problem is inherently risk-based

1. What are the risks imposed by human activities and natural phenomena on society and the environment?

2. Are these risks acceptable? (regulations)

3. What are there options for reducing these risks?

4. On what basis should we choose among these options?
---
# Risk management answers these questions

Process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk costs with mission benefits 

Integrating risk management into mission planning, preparation, and execution

Making risk decisions at the appropriate level in the chain of command

Accepting no unnecessary risk

Risk-informed, performance based decision making as part of design process (NRC paradigm)
