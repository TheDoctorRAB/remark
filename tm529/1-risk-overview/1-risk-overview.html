## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Risk assessment and management overview

# Learning outcomes

Understanding risk, analysis, and management

What risk analysis is used for/how it is done

Think critically about risk analysis and how to use them (social implications)

This was my first class at Berkeley (piazza)

Prof. W. E. Kastenberg, one of the pioneers in the field

Originally a main component at Diablo Valley College
I tend to jump around so tell me to stop to clarify

Chapters 1 - 3 in the book

This is a little all over the place but roll with it - that's most of the course

# What is risk?
---
# Risk is the possibility of loss

A dangerous factor  
Person or thing that is a specified hazard  

Hazard = Existing or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death; damage to, or loss of equipment and property; or degradation of the mission

Hazard identification  
Human studies  
Animal studies  
Cell/tissue studies  
Exposure surveys  
---
# Risk is the probability of an event multiplied by its consequences

Exposure to injury or loss

Risk level is expressed in terms of hazard probability and severity

Probability = Frequency that an event will occur

Severity = Expected result of an event (degree of injury, property damage or other mission impairing factors)

Exposure = frequency and length of time soldiers, equipment, and missions are subjected to a hazard

Controls = actions taken to eliminate or reduce the risks identified
---
# Then ‘safe’ means free from risk

Secure from threat of danger, harm or loss

Affording safety from danger

So can you really say anything is safe?

Should the engineer say something is safe?

Like a car, reactor, plane, space shuttle

What can you do?
---
# Risk assessment is the identification of hazards

Characterization of an individual hazard or all identified hazards combined to complete a task

Residual risk = level of risk remaining after controls have been implemented

Controls are altered until the residual risk is at an acceptable level or until it cannot practically be further reduced

Multiple hazards have varying residual risk

Kind of like ALARA in nuclear engineering problems 
---
# Risk analysis has been used primarily as a retrospective process

Developed by the US Space Program in 50s and 60s  
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to both correct missile and rocket failures

Reactor Safety Study [WASH-1400](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/pra-2/)  
Only after ~75 NPPs designed, built, operating in USA  
First real PRA analysis

Risk management came to prominence after TMI in 1979 

Limited number of plant specific PRAs  
[Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. Nuclear Power Plants](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1150/)  
First Level III full scope PRA  
---
# Level III assessments now done all the time to obtain operating license   

NRC paradigm now “Risk-Informed Decision Making” 
Risk assessment as one input into design and operational changes 

Deterministic and reductionistic

Highly dependent on detailed system analysis

Data driven and now big big data is a big big thing 

Unless you have no operational data cohorts like for pyroprocessing
---
# There are two types of risk

**Tactical/Mission risk** concerned with hazards that exist because of the presence of enemy or adversary  
(physical protection)

It applies to all levels of and across the spectrum of operations

**Accident risk** includes all operational risk considerations otherwise  
Risks posed to populace by an operation, as well as an operations impact on the environment

Activities associated with hazards concerning personnel, civilians, equipment readiness, and environmental conditions
---
class: center,middle

# Severity classified by varying degrees
---
## CATASTROPHIC (I)
Loss of ability to accomplish the mission or mission failure

Death or permanent total disability (accident risk)

Loss of major or mission-critical system or equipment

Major property ( facility) damage

Severe environmental damage

Mission-critical security failure 

Unacceptable collateral damage
---
## CRITICAL (II) 

Significantly (severely) degraded mission capability or unit readiness

Permanent partial disability, temporary total disability exceeding 3 months time (accident risk)

Extensive (major) damage to equipment or systems

Significant damage to property or the environment

Security failure

Significant collateral damage
---
## MARGINAL (III)  
Degraded mission capability or unit readiness

Minor damage to equipment or systems, property, or the environment

Lost day due to injury or illness not exceeding 3 months (accident risk)

Minor damage to property or the environment
---
## NEGLIGIBLE (IV)

Little or no adverse impact on mission capability

First aid or minor medical treatment (accident risk)

Slight equipment or system damage, but fully functional and serviceable

Little or no property or environmental damage
---
![Risk assessment matrix](img/risk.assessment.matrix.jpg)
---
# Any engineering problem is inherently risk-based

1. What are the risks imposed by human activities and natural phenomena on society and the environment?

2. Are these risks acceptable? (regulations)

3. What are there options for reducing these risks?

4. On what basis should we choose among these options?
---
# Risk management answers these questions

Process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk costs with mission benefits 

Integrating risk management into mission planning, preparation, and execution

Making risk decisions at the appropriate level in the chain of command

Accepting no unnecessary risk

Risk-informed, performance based decision making as part of design process (NRC paradigm)
---
# Risk management is the process of identifying, controlling hazards to conserve combat resources

Identify hazards to people, property, mission  
Past, present, future  
Complexity and difficulty of the mission/task  
Terrain and environment  
Weather and visibility  
Equipment on hand and status  
Time available for preparation/execution  
(Supervision, Experience, Training, Morale, Environment)
---
# Assess hazards to determine risks

Defense in depth   
Multiple barriers  
Eliminate common failure modes (huge problem)  
Safety margins to account for uncertainty  

Develop controls  
Implement controls  
Supervise and evaluate  


Risk assessment establishes situational awareness  
Management also cost/benefit analysis
---
# Leaders continuously assess the risk to the overall mission and to those involved in the task

Evaluate the effectiveness of controls

Provide lessons learned
---
# Risk has been around for a long time

“...the appearance of disease in human populations is influenced by the quality of air, water, and food; the topography of the land; and general living habits.

--Hippocrates
Air, Water and Places

Make sure everyone knows who this guy is

class: center,middle

# Where is risk analysis used?
---
# Risk analysis is used literally everywhere

Reactor safety  
Space shuttle  
Superfund sites  
Insurance and banking  
Information technology  
Cyber-physical systems (Michael Haney)  
Gambling and counting cards

My ex-wife  
Finding an apartment [analytical hierarchy procedure]  
Finding my house  
Deciding what dessert to have
---
# Risk analysis contains several complex elements

Probabalistic risk assessment: risks imposed by technologies  
Models needed due to lack of data (assumptions)

Risk/benefit: are the risks acceptable  
Involuntary v voluntary

Option generation: risk reduction  

Cost/benefit: and value/impact: evaluate options  
Typically greatest good for less cost  
How much will society pay to reduce risk  
---
# Risk assessment is people-centered

**Public health risk analysis**  
Determination of toxic material required to cause effect
Determination of the amount of exposure to the toxin

**Environmental risk**  
Location and strength of source  
Disperson  
Uptake  
Dose + effects + response = Health effects  
Population demographic at risk  
---
# Most assessments focus on acute fatalities and cancer deaths

Somatic effects = manifested in exposed individuals

Genetic effects = manifested in exposed individuals progeny

Deterministic effects = Severity proportional to dose

Stochastic effects = Incident rate of exposure proportional to dose
---
# Risk analysis involves both technical and institutional issues

What are the risks? (assessment): technical

Are the risks acceptable?: institutional, societal context, **regulations**

Can the risks be reduced?: (options) both but more technical

Evaluation of the options (risk/benefit, PRA): technical

But the decisions (management) based on the PRA are institutional

Because we're engineers here, we have to be technical experts

Yet also be socially literate
---
class: middle,center

# The event doesn't care about society

# Consequences are societal
---
# Risk analysis also involves human factors

In many cases a system being analyzed has very deterministic failures associated with it 

Which is where we get PRA

In reality, system failures are never well identified and humans and the organizations we create change the failure rates of systems

And we have to live with a lot of uncertainty

# Risk involves three essential questions
---
class: center,middle

# What can go wrong?

# How likely is it to happen?

# What are the consequences? 
---
# Risk analysis should start early in life cycle and continue

Preliminary hazard analysis early

Failure mode and effect analysis and fault tree analysis for conceptual design phases

Probabilistic risk assessment and human reliability analysis for mature designs

Continuing after system is real and is ongoing

Nuclear reactors, technical specifications, performance goals

Always after accidents
---
![bathtub curve](img/bath.jpe)

# A Weibull distribution can describe each part of the curve

$\beta < 1$  
No operational experience or real data cohort  
Would want to minimize time period with extensive testing and modeling

$\beta=1$  
Random failures

$\beta>1$  
So you want to know when you are heading in to here and make decisions about when to replace parts, equipment, etc.

$Q(t)=1-e^{-(\frac{t}{\eta})^{\beta}}$

# Frequency is not intuitive
---
# Monty Hall problem

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
 
You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. 

He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" 

Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? What is the probability?

When assessing frequency, intuition can be problematic

[Monty Hall explained](http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-monty-hall-problem/)
---
# No spin Russian roulette

Important to fully characterize risk and understand the real problem

**What could go wrong?**  
You have to shoot the gun

**How likely is it to happen?**  
These are 'dependent events' not like the NCAA tourney  
Because we are dependent on the chamber state AND player state

**What are the consequences?**  
Gun goes off, you die; slow singing, flower bringing

**Management options**  
Where should you sit to maximize you chance at life?
---
# Risk is the expected value of an undesirable event

$E[X] \equiv \int xf(x)dx$  
$E[X] \equiv \sum_i x_i f(x_i)$

This is the quantitative part of the risk analysis

Not always so easy due to uncertainties

E[DICE] = ?
---
# Uncertainties come in different flavors but are essential in risk

There are things we know we know.  

Then there’s things we know that we do not know.

But there’s still things that we don’t know we don’t know.
---
# Aleatory uncertainty is statistical

Random variations and chance outcomes in the physical world, natural randomness in a process

If a parameter sometimes has one value and sometimes has another values
---
# Epistemic uncertainty is systematic

Lack of knowledge about the physical world, scientific uncertainty in the model of the process

If a parameter always has either one value or another, but we are not sure which

[Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter](http://www.ripid.ethz.ch/Paper/DerKiureghian_paper.pdf)
---
# Risk = Frequency X Consequence

![Farmers chart](img/farmer.jpg)
---
# There is an ethical theory basis for risk

Based on universal rules and principles by Descartes  
(1596-1650)

Rights ethics by John Locke, not the guy from the Island  
(1632-1704)

Duties ethics by Immanuel Kant  
(1724-1804)

Utilitarianism by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill  
(1748-1832),(1806-1873)

‘Greatest good for greatest number of people’ (Red Wedding)

PRA (WASH1400) comes from this - ‘economic determinism’, cost/benefit
---
# Society determines acceptable risks

ALARA = as low as reasonably achievable (000/person/rem

Versus precautionary principle

Contaminated [superfund] sites and cancer risks

Safety goals for reactors, 0.1% of background cancer risk

So it is the regulations that determine the acceptable levels)
---
# How is that codified?

The USNRC has qualitative safety goals

Individuals bear no significant additional risk to life and health

Societal risks to life and health from nuclear power plant operation should be comparable to or less than the risks due to electric generation by competing technologies and should not be a significant addition to other societal risks

There’s more, but you get the idea
---
# What are some examples of utilitarianism in real life?

**Insurance**  
How much am I willing to spend each year to insure my house, car, life and for what amount?

**Energy**  
What risks am I willing to take for the benefit of 1000 MWe among a coal, natural gas, oil or nuclear power plant?

These are not strictly technically-based? Or not?
---
# Cost/benefit is the typical risk reduction mode

Rational decision maker will choose the option that maximizes utility

Or largest benefit/cost ratio

Multiattribute utilty theory uses functions to express risk aversion

Use of decision trees

AHP for when there is a lack of data 
(ANS proposal Verner! YAY)

Relies on expert judgement

Game theory for two party decision making

# Challenger
---
# The Challenger disaster occurred in 1986

The Space Shuttle management prior to the Challenger disaster felt that a failure would occur about 1 every 100,000 flights

Engineers calculated the failure rates between 1 in 100 and 1 in 556 missions pre-Challenger

In actuality the failure rates were 1 in 137 on launch and 1 in 137 on re-entry or 2 in 137 flights

Human decision process gravely impacted the Challenger mission 

How frequency is determined affects management options
---
class: middle,center

# Ford Pinto
---
# The Ford Pinto case is a classic study of risk/benefit and ethics

During design and production, crash tests revealed a serious
defect in the gas tank

In crashes over **25 miles per hour,** the gas tank always
ruptured

To correct it would have required changing and strengthening the design

So they didn’t

What other more contemporary examples are there?
