## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Probability and statistics

#### 2
---
# Learning outcomes

Demonstrating the importance of statistics  
Explaining the relevance to the field  
Analyzing and interpreting data  
Deconstructing myths about statistics  
Deriving basic metrics

Chapter 7 in the book

Has anyone taken a statistics course?

Math classes tend not to focus on engineering so it is annoying

Python very useful for statistical analysis

# What is probability?
---
# Probability theory was invented by Pascal and de Fermat for gambling

Anyone know how to count cards?  
Can up your odds in blackjack to almost over 50:50

What is the objective of blackjack?

Cards 2-6 have a value of +1  
Cards 7-9 have a value of 0  
Cards 10-A have a value of -1  

How are these 'probabilities'?

Keep a running total = running count  
Divide by the number of decks = true count

When would you want to bet high?

In a standard 6 deck blackjack game each true count will move the house edge half a percent toward the player

You still need to know how to play though
---
# Clearly, probability theory is essential for risk assessment

Perception of probability is not necessarily what the real probability is  
This was the point of Monty Hall and the modified Russian roulette

Risk perception is hugely important

Dice is usually a common starting example

And we know the expected value of dice

# Anyone play craps? 

Explained in Section 7.1 in the book

[Wizard of odds](http://wizardofodds.com/play/craps/v2/)

'off': bet pass, win if 7 or 11  
Probability?

'point': win if point is thrown before craps (2,3,12)

then the 'don't' is the opposite

there's a whole bunch of other bets: box cars, snake eyes, etc.  
what is the probability of these?

So the reason craps is popular is because there are a lot of favorable probabilities
---
# Event needs to be clearly characterized before deriving probabilities

Wrong probability if describing the wrong event  
Wrong assumptions

What is the probability of...

1. ...russian roulette spinning the chamber after each turn?  
2. ...winning the men's college basketball tournament?  
3. ...winning the superbowl?  
4. ...NBA title?  
5. I could only think of sports things...?

What is an independent event? Dependent event?
---
# Ground rules for probabilities

AND = multiply probabilities  
$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$

OR = add probabilities  
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

CONDITIONAL = B given A
P(theory|data) ~ P(data|theory) P(theory)  

[Bayes Theorem](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/bayes-theorem/)  

$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$  
$P(B|A) = \frac{P(B) P(A|B)}{P(A)}$
---
# More terms for probabilities

experiment = process by which an outcome is observed
and we get data

what experiments are we conducting in our research?

sample space = set of all possible outcomes

event = subset of sample space

joint probability = occurrences of two random variables
---
# We derive probability distributions from sample spaces

Why?  How can a distribution be derived?  
Probability is starting with an animal, and figuring out what footprints it will make  
Statistics is seeing a footprint, and guessing the animal  
Discrete or continuous

Probability density function  
$P(a \leq X \leq b) \equiv \int_a^b p(x)dx$  

Cumulative distribution or 'unreliability'  
$P(X \leq x) \equiv \int_{-\infty}^x p(\xi)d\xi$

Used to determine failure rates for safety analysis  
1st and 2nd [moments](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/statistical-moments/) are used to obtain expected value and variance 
---
# [Normal distribution](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/common-statistical-distributions/)

![Normal distribution](img/normal.distribution.png)
---
![Class grades](img/class.png)
---
# [Likelihood](https://courses.candelalearning.com/riskassessment/chapter/likelihood/) is a tool for summarizing the data’s evidence about unknown parameters

Normal distribution depends on two parameters   
$f(x;\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

f is a PDF when the parameters are constant and we vary in x  
f is a likelihood when x is constant and the parameters vary

A common application of the likelihood function is in estimation 

Estimate parameters from some given data x to understand how the function behaves
if it has 'fat tails' or really skewed
---
# There may not be a lot of data where the true mean, etc., could be directly obtained

Example of statistical inference

So, if a coin is 'fair' then we know p = 0.5 and can use the binomial distribution for the PDF
