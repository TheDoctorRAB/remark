## Try not to repeat the same material 

#### Quick review though
---
## Allow me to introduce the team again

Prof. Richard N. Christensen, University of Idaho-Idaho Falls (CAES)  
Nuclear Engineering Program Director

Prof. Brian Jaques - Boise State Univeristy  
Samuel Pedersen - Boise State University - Graduate Student

Mr. Takashi Suzuki - CEO - Sakae Casting

Mr. Mark Delligatti, President - Table Rock, LLC  
30 years experience in licensing casks at NRC

And additional work from Dr. Brenden Heidrich - NSUF R&D Infrastructure Lead
---
class: center,middle

## The story so far
### We received an Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission award
### Design of borated-Al used fuel cooling cask
---
## We have several challenges

Thermal cooling - determining heat transfer coeffients in the cooling tubes and cask materials - Rich

Materials optimization - Boron chemical form, solid solution with aluminum, homogeneity - Brian

Shielding - How thick will the cask be? How much boron do we need? - ME!

Licensing - What are the right regulations? What is needed for licensing? - ME!

Market penetration - Who wants it? - Sakae
---
## I discussed shielding design previously

Results for dose rate showed that there are considerable design challenges

Try backfill materials 

Put the cask in something else 

Get help
---
class: center,middle

## We had argued some pools are filling up  

### As partial justification for designing this cask  

#### (I talked about ROK because I knew it best from my Berkelely-KAERI postdoc)
---
class: center,middle

## Let's look at this now - USA, Europe, Asia
---
## We know the policy in the United States

Once through fuel cycle, no active repository, no interim storage

Fuel stored onsite in pools and some dry storage

75% pool capacity filled in 2011 and 63% pool capacity filled in 2017

About 55000 MTHM stored in the pools and 2200 MTHM discharged/year 

USA is using dry cask storage at many sites 

Lots of plants are extending the operating licenses, more fuel discharged

Argued either way - storage might be an issue long term or might be able to construct dry casks to keep up
---
class: center,middle

## France?

## Not really
---
## France has a closed fuel cycle

Reprocess 850 MTHM per year

EDF announced a plan to build 8000 MTHM centralized pool at Belleville-sur-Loire

~120 miles south of France
---
## UK not really either 

Operate advanced gas cooled reactors mostly

Sellafield reprocesses the AGR fuel 

There is a single PWR at the Sizewell B site

Dry cask construction started in 2016, and fuel was loaded in 2017

They also call the pools 'ponds' so if you're doing a search for used fuel data in the UK and use 'pools', you're going to waste about half a day figuring out they call them 'ponds'
---
## Germany and Belgium are phasing out nuclear

Germany has 7 operating reactors, down from 19

Germany exported used fuel to France for reprocessing

Currently have 16 dry storage facilities including a centralized one at Gorleben

Belgium also has 7 operating reactors 

Used fuel was reprocessed prior to 1999 ban

Remaining MOX fuel will be burned till it runs out

4 pools reracked

Some dry storage at Doel
---
## Europe does not look like a credible market

There might be a case for Belgium 

I couldn't find data on pool capacity

They are reracking, but since 2 plants shut down, but Doel 1 and 2 pools are empty

They built a new pool in repsonse to the reprocessing ban

It's not known how full that is either

I didn't look at Finland and Sweden because they already have repository sites
---
## ROK has 23 total reactors, 19 PWRs

6541 MTHM used fuel with 70% of space full in the pools at 4 sites

Could be filled by 2021

Public opposition to interim facilities becoming permanent 

Fabricated higher burnup fuel, reracked pools

Fuel transferred from older sites where storage is running out, to newer sites

Don't want to reprocess due to cost

And they would need to find somewhere to store subsequent reprocessing waste
---
## Taiwan has 6 reactors on 3 sites - 2 operating

3400 MTHM used fuel all in pools

Pool capacity at **97%**

Taiwanese legislature refused to approve restart at Kuosheng due to the lack onsite used fuel storage

Citizens concerned about a Fukushima-type pool accident because Taiwan is in similar region

Other political opposition to shipping fuel for reprocessing

Atomic Energy Council just issued construction license for dry cask storage at Kuosheng
---
## Japan and Fukushima is well known here

Loss of water in the pools led to partially melted fuel

Dry casks were in tact though

13000 MTHM used fuel with 55% capacity filled (2013) - could be higher now

Used to ship fuel overseas for reprocessing - ended in 2005

Rokkasho scheduled to open in 2021 (for now)

2900 MHTM stored at Rokkasho out of 3000 MTHM capacity

Dry casks in use at Fukushima and Tokai Daini

Local government approval required
---
## Asia is a potential market for the Sakae cask

Small countries

Centralized storage is problematic

Lack of onsite storage space

Difficulties with local approval

Limited development of dry cask storage

Sakae cask could alleviate space and extend time for dry cask construction
---
class: center,middle

## So what?
---
## Sakae has a path to pursue a market plan now

Visiting TaiPower this summer to talk about the cask

Attending an exposition in the UK in October

I suggested that NRC certification will offer a higher level of credibility

More attractive product

I wanted to start developing compliance guidelines now

If we can build a prototype, we use the guidelines as part of the testing program 
---
class: center,middle

## 10CFR72

#### Licensing Requirements for the Independent Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-level Radioactive Waste, and Reactor-Related Greater Than Class C Waste
---
## Dry storage has been in use in USA since 1986

Vendor obtains Certificate of Compliance under 10CFR72

Currently 4 companies have obtained compliance each with different models

NUHOMS, MAGNASTOR, HI-STAR, HI-STORM (51 total)

Operator also obtains a license to use the casks at the site

Defined as Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI)

Acronyms are why people hate us

Sakae cask is intended to be single use - storage at reactor site

Pools operate under power reactor license stipulated in 10CFR50
---
class: center,middle

## Dry storage cask inventory assessment (2016)

## FCRD-NFST-2014-000602, Revision 2

### Robert H. Jones, Jr. 
---
## 10CFR72 has a lots of subparts and paragraphs

It's a bit of a challenge to communicate 

What I did was just go through the regulation, identify relevant parts

Explain how we would have to demonstrate compliance

I was hoping there would be specific performance measure

I made a #fancy table, but it's impossible to reproduce here

I'm just going to hit the relevant parts of the regulation
---
## We don't start until Subpart F

### General design criteria

||Part||Description||Action item||
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|
||72.120b.1||GTCC can't be sotred with the used fuel||Sakae cask is only for used fuel||
||72.124a||Criticality safety||Demonstrate subcritical configuration with MCNP modeling||
||72.128a.1||Test, monitor safety components||Wait till prototype design||
||72.128a.2||Shielding||My current task||
||72.188a.4||Heat removal||Current research||
---
## Subpart G addresses quality assurance

I'm admittedly not so strong in this area

||Part||Description||Action item||
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|
||72.140b||QA program||Sakae QA on June 8||
||72.144c||QA requirements||Need Sakae review||
||72.146a||Quality standard design||Need Sakae review||
||72.154a||Purchased material||When boron loading is determined||
||72.158 ||Special processes||May be relevant to boron loading||

The problem here is we need to know how the boron-Al mix can be done first

Then modify Sakae QA program

It's also not clear if this applies to compuational tools
---
## Subpart L lists requirements for approval

||Part||Description||Action item||
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|
||72.230a||Application||Safety analysis report||
||72.236a||Specify fuel type||PWR||
||72.236b||Design basis for safety||Safety analysis report||
||72.236c||Criticality safety||Current research||
||72.236d||Radiation shielding||Current research||
||72.236e||Redundant sealing||Prototype phase||
||**72.236f**||Passive cooling||Not currently||
||72.236g||Cask lifecycle||Current research||
||72.236h||Loading/unloading compatiblity||Prototype phase||
---
class: center,middle

## What's next?
---
## This turned out to be really interesting 

Subpart F seems like we have covered mostly as part of research process

Working on QA with Sakae and Boise State on Subpart G

Also will look for other cask company QA programs

Getting help from Mark on Subpart L with other safety analysis reports

He licensed one of the Holtec designs

Already working on passively cooled design with Rich

Other materials from Brenden like NUGREGs and RGs

Find students I can actually pay to help me
