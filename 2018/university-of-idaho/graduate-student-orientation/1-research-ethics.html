## Strategies for success

1. Learn to write
2. Write
3. Write more
4. Write even more
5. Still write more
6. Write all of the things  
7. No outline slide at the start of your presentation - Prof. Jamie Coble (UTK) @radioactivegan 

And don't use Excel graphs

You can have the best idea in the world, but if you can't write it down, you can't communicate it effectively and share your work through papers 
---
## How can early students build writing and research skills?

Understand research is a process  

A good first step is reading lots of papers and putting together a literature review

This is going to be needed for anything - paper, thesis, proposal

A follow up to that is developing a white paper

Many students can combine these into a journal paper - critical review identifying gaps in the research field

Talk to faculty to learn what they are doing - next steps in the research process

Ask to contribute to proposals - further steps in the research process
---
## Recognize that graduate school is your job 

It's a good job that will lead to better jobs

Your success is what you put into it

Take advantage of the unique opportunies to be here in Idaho Falls

Network with INL as much as you can and make yourself known to them

This leads to internships

Take initiative to direct your own research

Make regular time to search for fellowships and scholarships

Check out the [Fellowship Atlas](https://www.uidaho.edu/cogs/secure?destination=/cogs/secure/atlas) on the University web site
---
## Ethics in research means being honest and sincere in your work and communicating well to colleagues

Everyone communicates differently - Just ask to make sure you're doing ok 

More formally, there are offical university and agency policies that projects office and professors get help with

Regular meetings are ok to communicate your work

I tend to fall on the side of 'stand up meetings' 5 - 10 minutes to bounce off ideas and provide updates

(Though there may be instances where more time is needed if a problem is challenging)
---
## Be magnanimous in giving or sharing credit in progress and successes

Remember to credit or cite any sources or people that have assisted in your research 

Or seminal works in the field

This could be as simple as an acknowledgment at the end of your paper

Citations are very important because reviews will look at that first

You will have a good citation list from your literature review though

You don't want to get a bad name for not including sources/people 
---
## Be careful with authorship, but lean towards credit

First author - usually you because you're doing a ton of work

Last author - Me. Put me on all the papers

Last author is major professor/PI who wrote and is directing the project

Middle? - you're choice

Did they make a **meaningful** contribution to the paper? 

Could be another professor or a student - we've done this
