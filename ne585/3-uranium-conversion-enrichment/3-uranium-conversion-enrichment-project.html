### Uranium conversion and enrichment
####[500]

<p>

1. [100] Compute $\frac{\partial{SWU}}{\partial{x_P}}$. What can this tell us about proliferation?

2. [100] Plot the derivative above for $x_P = 0.03 - 0.05$.

3. [50] How are uranium tails managed? Critically discuss this issue.

4. [100] What would be the speed and radius of a gas centrifuge that would make it equivalent to gas diffusion?  
What are contemporary dimensions of the gas centrifuge? How does it compare (bascially, which is better?)

5. [100] The minimum number of stages for an ideal cascade is given by $N = \frac{2}{ln \alpha}ln[\frac{x_P(1-x_w)}{x_W(1-x_P}]-1$. Plot N for 1% - 100%. How does this inform the solutions to 1 and 2? Take the derivative of N with respect to enrichment and see if that helps.

6. [50] Taking the second cost equation (below), what is the driver or limiting factor for cost? What needs to happen for a plant to be profitable? What challenges are there?

CHALLENGE: The book gives enrichment cost as $PE = (PU+PC) \frac{F}{P} + PS \cdot SWU$  
PE = enriched U price; PU = natural uranium price; PC = conversion price; PS = SWU price  

And there is another $c_P=[V_P-V_F-(x_P-x_F) \frac{V_F-V_W}{x_f-x_w}]c_S+(\frac{x_P-x_W}{x_F-x_w})c_F$  
$c_P=PE;c_S=PS;c_F=feed;V_i=V(x_i)$

Can you derive either?
