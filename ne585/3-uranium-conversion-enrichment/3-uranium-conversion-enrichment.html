# Outcomes for the lecture

Chapter 3

Model enrichment processes

Demonstrate principles of enrichment and converstion

Apply principle of separative work
---
# Uranium enrichment derived from WWII

Facilities needed to make bombs initially

Then used the uranium for submarines (but we can't talk about that)

When moving to commercial power, infrastructure already in place

Gaseous diffusion first invented at Oak Ridge

Needed lots of electricity from TVA

Uranium hexafluoride used for enrichment
---
# Yellowcake needs to be purified first

Impurities are rare earths, chlorine cadmium

Uranium readily forms chemical compounds (lots of oxidation states)
Can be extracted by organic solvents (like PUREX)

Uranium forms complexes that can be precipitated out
---
# There are different forms that are mined 

Forms of $UO_2$ and $UO_3$

$xUO_2 \cdot yUO_3$  
$0<y/x<2$

$K_2O \cdot 2UO_3 \cdot V_2O_5 \cdot xH_2O$  
$CaO \cdot 2UO_3 \cdot P_2O_5 \cdot xH_2O$

Goal is to get it as $UO_3^{2+}$ and then acid or alkaline leaching  
$UO_3+2H^+ \rightarrow UO_2^{2+}+H_2O$

$UO_2+2FE^{3+} \rightarrow UO_2^{2+}+2Fe^{2+}$
---
# Acid leaching is like PUREX using organic solvent

$UO_2^{2+}+2NO_3+2TBP \rightarrow UO_2(NO_3)_2 \cdot 2TBP$  
$UO_2(NO_3)_2+2H_2O_2+H_2O \rightarrow UO_4 \cdot 2H_2O +2HNO_3$

precipitates uranium peroxide 

$2Na_2S_2O_3+UO_4+H_2O \rightarrow Na_2S_4O_6+UO_3+2NaOH$

Or use ammonium hydroxide $2UO_2^{2+}+6NH_4(OH) \rightarrow (NH_4)_2U_2O_7+4NH_4^++3H_2O$

Then dry and calcine to get $UO_3$  
If alkaline leaching is used, recover $U_3O_8$
---
# Uranium hexafluoride has favorable properties

<img align="left" src="img/uf6.phase.diagram.gif">  
Solid at room temperature
Easy to handle

Relatively low pressure and not too high temperature to sublimate
---
# Conversion applies hydrofluor process

Crushed $U_3O_8$ and $UO_3$ is reduced by hydrogen to get 'crude' $UO_2$

$U_3O_8+2H_2 \rightarrow 3UO_2+2H_2O$  
$UO_3+H_2 \rightarrow UO_2+H_2O$

Then hydrofluorinized (I made that up) $UO_2+4HF \rightarrow UF_4+2H_2O$  
$UF_4$ is a solid green salt with a high melting point (1700F)

Treated with fluorine gas and distilled  
$UF_4+F_2 \rightarrow UF_6$
---
# Enrichment based on different diffusion rates

Separation factor is defined as $\alpha \equiv \frac{v_5}{v_8}=\sqrt{\frac{m_8}{m_5}}$  
Based on kinetic energy of the molecule $kT = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

This just says lighter molecules move faster

$\alpha = 1.004289$ for uranium enrichment  

Higher value, easier enrichment

This isn't that high  
Low enrichment takes a lot of energy
---
# Cascades are designed to enrich

<img align="left" src="img/enrichment.stage.jpg">
Basic operation is the stage  

Join stages to form cells

Cells form unit

Together all that is a cascade
---
# Enriching and stripping stages added for efficiency

[Sample cascade](http://www.atomicheritage.org/sites/default/files/Gas_Diffusion.gif)

Feed enters to A-1  
Enriched feed goes through B-2 and depleted through the bottom stage

Moving up is higher enrichment
---
# Enrichment based on mass conservation

<img align="left" src="img/enrichment_material.flow.jpg">

$F=P+W$   
$x_FF=x_PP+x_WW$  

separation factor ratio between product and tails  
$\alpha \equiv \frac{x_P(1-x_P)^{-1}}{x_W(1-x_W)^{-1}}$
---
# Enrichment based on mass conservation

$x_F$  = weight fraction $^{235}U$ feed into system  
$x_P$  = weight fraction $^{235}U$ product (enrichment target)  
$x_W$  = weight fraction $^{235}U$ waste stream (depleted U)

F = mass flow rate feed  
P = mass flow rate product  
W = mass flow rate waste stream

Six equations and two variables
---
# Enrichment based on mass conservation

$x_F$ fixed at 0.00711  
$x_P$ enrichment target  
$x_w$ 0.002 - 0.003 depends on company (cost)

P target mass

$\frac{F}{P}=\frac{x_P-x_W}{x_F-x_w}$  
Feed factor gives mass of U needed to feed into system for target enrichment

Similarly waste factor: $\frac{W}{P}=\frac{x_P-x_F}{x_F-x_W}=\frac{F}{P}-1$
---
# Separative work unit is a measure of 'effort' to enrich

SWU proportional to electric energy needed to enrich  
Measure of cost

Thermodynamic work needed to create a quantity of enriched U

$SWU=PV(x_P)+WV(x_W)-FV(x_F)$

Separation potential is $V(x_i)=(2x_i-1)ln(\frac{x_i}{1-x_i})$ from thermodynamics

Change in entropy when binary mix of perfect gasses is separated
---
# Separation potential is a measure of differences in Gibbs free energy

[Value function](http://energyfromthorium.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/valueFunctionPlot.gif)

What does this tell us?

Net free energy difference is always positive  
But individual free energies may change sign as add or subtract from mixture

Gibbs free energy is zero at x = 0.5  
Minimum work, not actual

How many stages are needed to produce a pure isotope?
---
# SWU is normalized to mass of product

$\frac{SWU}{P}=V(x_P)+\frac{W}{P}V(x_W)-\frac{F}{P}V(x_F)$  

Based on factors computed before

## How are tails managed?

# Only one company enriches by gaseous diffusion

United States Enrichment Corporation established in 1992  
Energy Policy Act

1998 privatized with an IPO so you can buy stock

Operates plant in Paducah up to 5%
---
# Enrichment also done by centrifuge

[URENCO](https://urenco.com/) established in 1970 with UK, Dutch, Germany  
Still going strong

Construction of USA plant in 1977 in Ohio, but Reagan scrapped it in favor of laser separation

Rotating drum causes centrifugal force to compress gas molecules to the outer wall

Velocity of molecules separates differing those of differing weights

Light molecules collect near center of drum
---
# Still based on conservation of mass

<img align="left" src="img/gas.centrifuge.jpg">

Lighter $U^{235}$ molecules collect toward center

$\alpha=exp^{\frac{(m_8-m_5) \omega^2 a^2}{2RT}} \approx 1+ \frac{(m_8-m_5) \omega^2 a^2}{2RT}$ 

Rotational motion of he centrifuge accelerates gas molecules toward  wall  

Counteracting diffusive force thermal motion of molecules seeks to distribute the gas evenly  

Two forces balance to create a dynamic equilibrium  
Pressure distribution in the rotor that is function of the molecular mass

$p(r)=p_0 exp^{\frac{m \omega^2 r^2}{2RT}}$; $\omega$=angular speed, r, a=radius [OER](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/front-end-of-the-fuel-cycle/)
---
class: center,middle

# Which is better?
---
# Design based on separative power

$SWU = \frac{\pi \rho DL}{2}(\frac{\Delta m \omega^2}{2RT})^2$ theoretical separative power 

density of uranium hexafluoride; isotope self-diffusion; mass difference; length of rotor

Proportional to length and 4th power of speed

Inverse to temperature squared

What does this say about how to design the centrifuge?

It's actually small SWU per centrifuge, so up to 100,000 needed forr 9 million SWU/y

That would be needed for industrial scale
---
# There are only 3 companies in the USA interested in centrifuges

USEC Inc. (USEC)  
[Louisiana Energy Services (LES)](https://www.nirs.org/les/)  
AREVA Enrichment Services (AES)

USEC submitted application to operate a commercial facility  
American Centrifuge Plant (ACP) August 2004  
NRC issued a license April 2007  
Construction of the facility is currently on hold (did not get DOE grant)  
Chapter 11 in 2014 - now called [Centrus Energy Corp](http://www.centrusenergy.com/)
---
# There are only 3 companies in the USA interested in centrifuges

LES submitted license application NRC December 2003 for a 3 million SWU/year facility  
One-third of the United States demand   
Lea County, New Mexico  
June 2006 NRC issued LES a license to construct and operate its facility


Began operations in June 2010 while continuing construction  
Part of [URENCO](https://urenco.com/about-us/company-structure/urenco-usa/)  
July 2014 all cascades operational 
---
# There are only 3 companies in the USA interested in centrifuges

AES submitted a license application for Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility to NRC in December 2008  
18 miles west of Idaho Falls!  

NRC issued the Safety Evaluation Report (NUREG-1951) in September 2010  
Final Environmental Impact Statement (NUREG-1945) in February 2011

October 2011 NRC issued AES license to construct and operate the [Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility](http://www.new.areva.com/EN/operations-780/the-eagle-rock-enrichment-facility-enrichment-by-centrifugation.html)

# Lasers can be used for enrichment

Started in 1985

Absorption spectrum of uranium metal vapor  
More than 300,000 lines at visible wavelengths 

Sufficient displacement between lines
Selective excitation of $^{235}U$ based on laser wavelength

Requires liquid uranium at 2300C
Laser at 5915 angstroms to excite U-235  
Ultraviolet light at 3100 angstroms ionizes U-235  
Then it is collected in a Faraday cup

Low throughput, high temperature, high energy

---
# Lasers can be used for enrichment

<img align="left" src="img/laser.enrichment.jpg">
GE got [operating license](https://nuclear.gepower.com/fuel-a-plant/products/gle) for a facility

Doesn't seem like much progress, limited testing with DU in Paducah

Different process than what we were just talking about though (coming up)

Looking to construct in WIlmington
---
<img align="left" src="img/han.solo.jpg">
---
# Molecular separation uses uranium hexafluoride

Uses different vibrational and rotational states between isotopes

Almost the same procedure

U-235 molecule is dissociated and precipitates to a $^{235}UF_5 powder$

Need to reduce the vapor pressure to 77K 
---
<img align="left" src="img/real.genius.jpg">
---
# SILEX seems to be state of the art

Uses carbon dioxide laser at 10.8 um and amplified to 16 um  
Infrared spectrum

Preferentially excites U-235

Again trapped electromagnetically

Still inefficient due to laser frequency
---
# Price used to be set by government

<img align="left" src="img/swu.png">

From Atomic Energy Act 1954

Prices then set by USEC based on market conditions

I don't know if this is right

Below [$50/SWU](http://www.neimagazine.com/opinion/opinionuranium-enrichment-why-are-prices-now-much-lower-and-what-is-the-impact-5692128/)

Used to be high because of high energy requirements of gaseous diffusion plants

What now?
---
# World capacity is estimated at 56 million SWU

[World enrichment capacity](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/conversion-enrichment-and-fabrication/uranium-enrichment.aspx)

US demand at 15 million SWU per year

Import a lot from Europe, Russia, China

Do we need to though?
