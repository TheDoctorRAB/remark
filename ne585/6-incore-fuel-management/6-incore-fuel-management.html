# NE585
## NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
### Incore fuel management 

#### 6
---
# Outcomes for the lecture

Understanding how fuel is managed in the core for maximum burnup

Chapter 6 in the book 
---
# Then the author says there's no real meaning to 'fuel management'

The main component of fuel management is access to nuclear materials

Analyzing fuel performance in the core

Power history of the reactor

Core loading

Refueling

Storage and disposal
---
# Reactor operation is constrained by operational parameters

Need sufficient reactivity

Core needs reactivity control

Refueling needs to be during period of low demand

Fast neutron flux on the RPV should be reduced 

Why? 
---
# There are also several regulatory constraints 

Peak to average power ratio

Maximum core temperature

Deviation from nucleate boiling

Core reactivity

Temperature coefficient 
---
# Fuel cost needs to be minimized

Though it's not a huge expense

Back in the 1950s, federal government was to buy reactor produced Pu to use in breeders  

Plants also thought that the government was going to take back used fuel after 5 years

So there was only limited onsite storage

Also assumed reprocessing

Wow they were optimistic
---
# The federal government issued a [GESMO](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0710/ML071000110.pdf) in the 70s which is a stupid acronym

It stands for Generic environmental impact statement for mixed oxide fuel

The idea was that there were going to be a lot of reprocessing facilities

AEC concluded based on study from 1957 to 1972 that "widescale use of mixed oxide fuel should be approved"

Published in August 1974 - became the NRC in 1975
---
# [Carter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/10/01/why-doesnt-u-s-recycle-nuclear-fuel/#d8c1550390f1) canceled reprocessing in 1977

Thanks, Obama. 

The idea was the risk of Pu diversion

Even though USA is a nuclear weapons state

But he wanted other nations to follow suit

Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but there wasn't any other investment

Carter cited it not being cost effective 

But the report indicated starting soon that it would be

There's also been zero cases of civilian diversion to start a weapons program
---
# We even have [Carter's](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7316) speech

The benefits of nuclear power are thus very real and practical. But a serious risk accompanies worldwide use of nuclear power--the risk that components of the nuclear power process will be turned to providing atomic weapons.

First, we will defer indefinitely the commercial reprocessing and recycling of the plutonium produced in the U.S. nuclear power programs. From our own experience, we have concluded that a viable and economic nuclear power program can be sustained without such reprocessing and recycling.

Third, we will redirect funding of U.S. nuclear research and development programs to accelerate our research into alternative nuclear fuel cycles which do not involve direct access to materials usable in nuclear weapons.

Yet you're still burning Pu in the reactors anyway
---
# Without reprocessing, plants were running out of storage space

Redesign pools to rack more fuel

Extend the burn cycle to 24 months 

Requires higher enrichment so increased costs because SWU is intensive
