# NE585
## NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
### Incore fuel management 

#### 6
---
# Outcomes for the lecture

Understanding how fuel is managed in the core for maximum burnup

Chapter 6 in the book 
---
# Then the author says there's no real meaning to 'fuel management'

The main component of fuel management is access to nuclear materials

Analyzing fuel performance in the core

Power history of the reactor

Core loading

Refueling

Storage and disposal
---
# Reactor operation is constrained by operational parameters

Need sufficient reactivity

Core needs reactivity control

Refueling needs to be during period of low demand

Fast neutron flux on the RPV should be reduced 

Why? 
---
# There are also several regulatory constraints 

Peak to average power ratio

Maximum core temperature

Deviation from nucleate boiling

Core reactivity

Temperature coefficient 
---
# Fuel cost needs to be minimized

Though it's not a huge expense

Back in the 1950s, federal government was to buy reactor produced Pu to use in breeders  

Plants also thought that the government was going to take back used fuel after 5 years

So there was only limited onsite storage

Also assumed reprocessing

Wow they were optimistic
---
# The federal government issued a [GESMO](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0710/ML071000110.pdf) in the 70s which is a stupid acronym

It stands for Generic environmental impact statement for mixed oxide fuel

The idea was that there were going to be a lot of reprocessing facilities

AEC concluded based on study from 1957 to 1972 that "widescale use of mixed oxide fuel should be approved"

Published in August 1974 - became the NRC in 1975
---
# [Carter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/10/01/why-doesnt-u-s-recycle-nuclear-fuel/#d8c1550390f1) canceled reprocessing in 1977

Thanks, Obama. 

The idea was the risk of Pu diversion

Even though USA is a nuclear weapons state

But he wanted other nations to follow suit

Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but there wasn't any other investment

Carter cited it not being cost effective 

But the report indicated starting soon that it would be

There's also been zero cases of civilian diversion to start a weapons program
---
# We even have [Carter's](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7316) speech

The benefits of nuclear power are thus very real and practical. But a serious risk accompanies worldwide use of nuclear power--the risk that components of the nuclear power process will be turned to providing atomic weapons.

First, we will defer indefinitely the commercial reprocessing and recycling of the plutonium produced in the U.S. nuclear power programs. From our own experience, we have concluded that a viable and economic nuclear power program can be sustained without such reprocessing and recycling.

Third, we will redirect funding of U.S. nuclear research and development programs to accelerate our research into alternative nuclear fuel cycles which do not involve direct access to materials usable in nuclear weapons.

Yet you're still burning Pu in the reactors anyway
---
# Without reprocessing, plants were running out of storage space

Redesign pools to rack more fuel

Extend the burn cycle to 24 months 

Higher burnup fuels to 50 GWD/MTU

Requires higher enrichment so increased costs because SWU is intensive

Roses are red  
Violets are blue  
No one likes nuclear  

Because we use SWU
---
# Nuclear waste policy act (1982, 1987) addressed storage issue

Among the other issues about siting a repository

DOE obligated to take used fuel from plants for final disposal  

If plant needs storage space before government can take the fuel, interim storage must be provided

Utilities paid $0.001/kWh to the Nuclear Waste Fund

Since 1983, more than [$30 billion collected](https://www.nei.org/Knowledge-Center/Nuclear-Statistics/Costs-Fuel,-Operation,-Waste-Disposal-Life-Cycle/Nuclear-Waste-Fund-Payment-Information-by-State) - suspended in [May 2014](https://www.nei.org/News-Media/News/News-Archives/What-NARUC-Sees-on-the-Nuclear-Waste-Fee-Suspensio)

[NEI Urges DOE, OMB to Address Nuclear Waste Fund Inequities](https://www.nei.org/News-Media/News/News-Archives/2017/NEI-Urges-DOE,-OMB-to-Address-Nuclear-Waste-Fund-I)

# Not core management, but extending operating license to keep plants going 

While many plants did get [license renewals](https://www.nrc.gov/images/reading-rm/doc-collections/maps/power-reactors-license-renewals.png), there's still closures

[Status of License Renewal Applications and Industry Activities](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications.html)

Then we have to worry about instrumentation and control upgrades because Radio Shack closed

RPV suffers radiation damage from neutron bombardment

Why does this happen?

Low leakage core management strategies were developed
---
# Core has assemblies with different initial enrichments

Batch = group of assemblies of same fuel type and enrichment

So core is reloaded by batch

$B \equiv \frac{P_0 \cdot \epsilon \cdot T}{M(t)}$

$\epsilon \equiv \frac{\int_0^T P(t) dt}{P_0 T}$

So burnup is proportional to initial of enrichment of fuel  
But we knew that
---
# Initial reactivity is also proportional to enrichment

$\rho \equiv \frac{k-1}{k}$

Once the reactor starts operating, negative reactivity increases due to poisons

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{200}&space;\rho_{net}&space;=&space;\rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" title="\rho_{net} = \rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" />

Not sure this is precise enough  
What's missing?

Positive reactivity decreases linearly with time

$\rho = \rho_0-aB$
---
# What is net reactivity at critical?

That's where the control rods come in

Reactivity control from boric acid, control rods

Boron is removed from coolant over the cycle

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{200}&space;\rho_{net}&space;=&space;\rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" title="\rho_{net} = \rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" />

Reactivity swing is the positive reactivity in the core available during operation

Should be minimal because you don't want to have to use the control rods to suck up all the neutrons
---
# Cores operate on multiple batches

This changes reactivity calculations  
Operator needs to know real-time reactivity though

For the one batch core: $\rho_1(t) = \rho_0[1-\frac{B_1^1(t)}{B(T)}]$

$\rho_0$ is fresh fuel reactivity for unburned core

$\rho_1(t)$ is the time dependent reactivity at t

$B_N^n(t)$ is burnup of a batch at cycle n in the N-batch core at t

$B(T)$ is final burnup in the core at end of life

[So $\rho_1(T) = 0$](img/core_one.batch.jpg)
---
# Use of multiple batches reduces the reactivity swing

The book is terrible at explaining this

Assume the total core reactivity is the average of the batch reactivities

$\rho_2(t)=\frac{\rho_0}{2}[(1-\frac{B_2^1(t)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{B_2^2(t)}{B(T)})]$   
$\rho_3(t)=\frac{\rho_0}{3}[(1-\frac{B_3^1(t)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{B_3^2(t)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{B_3^3(t)}{B(T)})]$

Assume equal fractional contribution of burnup in each batch

$\rho_2(T)=\frac{\rho_0}{2}[(1-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{B_2(T)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{2}{2}\cdot\frac{B_2(T)}{B(T)})]$     
$\rho_3(T)=\frac{\rho_0}{3}[(1-\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{B_3(T)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{B_3(T)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{3}{3}\cdot\frac{B_3(T)}{B(T)})]$
---
# And increases burnup

With $\rho_N(T)=0$

$B_2(T)=\frac{4}{3}B(T)$

$B_3(T)=\frac{3}{2}B(T)$
