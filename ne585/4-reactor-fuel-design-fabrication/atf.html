# NE585
## NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
### Reactor fuel design and fabrication 

#### 4
---
# continuing from end of book chapter 4
---
# LOCA results in partial meltdown of nuclear fuel

We know hydrogen generation will occur with reaction of water and cladding

ATF caught on after Fukushima a lot more

Fuel designs have to be compatible with existing reactor systems
---
# The goal is enhanced performance at high temperatures

Improved reaction kinetics with steam  

Improved fuel properties  

Enhanced retention of fission products

Slower hydrogen generation rate

Improved classing properties
---
# Tolerate loss of active cooling for longer time

Backward compatible with current fabrication facilities

Increase burnup

Less assemblies per reload

Ehanced safety in off normal conditions

Cost competitive
---
# Fuel cycle R&D campaign adopted three phased approach to ATF commercialization

Feasability assessment and down selection  

Development and qualification  
Irradiation testing

Commercialization  
---
# As of 2014, there are several efforts going on

Georgia Tech got an IRP to build a new LWR concept  
Non oxide fuel form

Los Alamos is working on new alloys  
FeCrAl and Mo  
Mo has improved ductility and oxidation resistance  
High melting point (2600 C)
---
# Performance benefits to uranium oxide modifications are being studied

Improved fracture toughness and plasticity

Enhanced thermal conductivity

Ehnanced oxidation resistance

Evolutionary approach
---
# PNNL is developing a U-Mo fuel concept

I thought INL was actually doing that

High linear heat rate, power density, burnup

Triple layer of annualr U-Mo - Nb,Cr,Al - Cladding

Based on experiences from production reactors at Hanford
---
# Areva is working on improved performance

Cr doping in the fuel pellet to reduce fission gas generation

SiC fibers in the pellet for thermal heat transfer  
Also lock up iodine in the fuel

Coating Zr to reduce hydrogen pickup
---
# Tennessee working on ceramic coating for Zr cladding

Nitrides, oxides, carbides

"C3 project"

Decrease oxidation and hydrogen pickup

During LOCA, delay oxidation of Zr
---
# Irradiation testing to be done at ATR

Results will inform down selection of concepts

Eventually testing those designs in TREAT
