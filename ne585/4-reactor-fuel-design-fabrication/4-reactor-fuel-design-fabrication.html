## NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
### Reactor fuel design and fabrication 

#### 4
---
# Outcomes for the lecture

Chapter 4

Design different fuel concepts

Assess fule performance

Analyze fuel cost as a component in the fuel cycle
---
# What's the advantage of nuclear

Construction costs are really high  
Hopefully modularization will help reduce that

The real advantage is the high capacity factor

[Fossil fuel sources](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_07_a)

[Non fossil fuel sources](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_07_b)

# Defense in depth used for fuel design

<img align="left" src="img/fuel.pin.jpg">

In LWRs  
Fuel matrix for structural integrity  
Material that won't melt 

Technically not really if LFTR

Cladding to protect fuel from coolant  
Can't melt either 

Must contain fuel and prevent fission product release in the event of fuel failure

We can talk about fuel for different reactors though
---
# Materials are the strongest design constraint

One reason why NuScale is so far ahead is because the fuel is the same

Other factors are  
reactivity  
heat transfer  
structural containment  
no neutron absorbers  
---
# Fuel has to be cost effective

Long residency in the core 

Standard design for ready production (use in a lot of reactors)

Reliability - transients

[Quality control](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/oversight/quality-assurance.html)

Technology-neutral
---
# Uranium fuel used as metal first

Zircaloy clad

[Any guesses where?](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/fuel-cycle-analysis/)

$UF_4+2Mg \rightarrow 2MgF_2+U$

We can also get it from electrorefining

Uranium metal has three allotropes
---
# $\alpha$ phase is stable up to 600C

<img align="left" src="img/orthorhombic.jpg">

Anisotropic

When heated, expands in two different directions and contracts in a third

Crystal structure highly asymmetrical

Only Mo and Nb form solid solutions

Do we know anyone working with U-Mo?
---
# $\beta$ phase is stable between 660C to 700C

<img align="left" src="img/tetragonal.png">

Also anisotropic

Both phases orient in preferred direction when metal is deformed

Brittle and hard
---
# $\gamma$ phase is stable from 760C to 1130C

<img align="left" src="img/bcc.png">

This is isotropic

Is this better to use?

Irradiation adversely affects thermal conductivity

How? 
---
# Commercial fuel in LWRs is $UO_2$ ceramic

<img align="left" src="img/UO2.jpg">

[Why?](http://www.pbs.org/program/rickover-birth-nuclear-power/)

Crystallizes in fluorite structure

Face centered cubic lattice

Oxygen in tetrahedral sites

[Phase diagram](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/geosciences/people/faculty/parise/Parise%20Website%201.png)
---
# $UO_2$ is used because oxygen has low neutron capture

Structurally very stable

Coolant is a harsh environment

Fission products stay trapped in the matrix

But that causes expansion of the fuel

High melting point $2865^o C$
---
class: center, middle

# What's the down side though?
---
# Uranium oxide fuel isn't actually that great on heat transfer

Low thermal conductivity

[<img align="left" src="img/therm.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel#/media/File:ZrUthermalcond.png)

10 - 5 W/m/K

Surprisingly hard to find comparative data

[Figure 11](https://neup.inl.gov/SiteAssets/Final%20%20Reports/NEUP-Project-09-773-Final-Report.pdf)

High temperatures cause high thermal gradients

How is heat transferred to the coolant?
---
# High temperatures cause grain growth

<img align="left" src="img/grain.jpg">

Crystal lattice increase at high temperatures

But the fuel is constrained in the cladding

High temperatures disordered boundaries means that vacancies can diffuse rapidly   
Leading to rapid creep

Which leads to what?

Boundaries have high energy  
Nucleation - fission products
---
# Thermal gradients cause pellets to look like hourglass

<img align="left" src="img/voids.jpg">

Thermal stress can cause cracking

Voids form with fission gas

Migrate to grain boundaries

Fission gas can still be contained by the cladding
---
# Linear heat rate decreases with burnup

Less thermal expansion with irradation

Reduces the heat transfer with increasing core life of fuel

Couldn't find a graph for this though
---
# Fuel also grows with burnup

Actual growth due to anisotropy of crystal

Swelling from grain boundaries and FP gas formation

Pellet density decreases due to void formation

Neutrons knock atoms out of the lattice creating interstitials

Percent change in volume up to 0.7%

How does this affect fuel performance?

Other U ceramic fuels if there's time
---
# Fuel cladding serves many functions

Protects fuel from corrosion

Contains fission products

Facilitates heat transfer
---

class: middle, center 

# What are cladding design requirements?
---
# Stainless steel first used 

But that was for fast reactors

Absorption cross section is too high in thermal region

Zr and Be are the only metals with melting points about 1000C

Why not Be then?

Zr is always stuck with hafnium which has high neutron absorption

So more chemical processing to remove the hafnium

Zircaloy was developed for cladding ($1850^o C$ melting point)

Contains other elements Sn, Fe, Cr, Ni
---
# SiC melts at $2730^o C$

Robust in molten salts up to $800^o C$

Lower neutron absorption

Greater resistance to radiation damage

Problematic in terms of mechanical strength

It seems to me like we are too locked in to LWR paradigms
---
# Burnable poisons are for reactivity control and fuel utilization

Fresh core is loaded with excess reactivity

Overcome burned fuel, fission product neutron absorbers, negative temperature feedback

Always need excess reactivity to in order to increase reactor power

How will this affect load following for SMRs? 
---
# Boron is one of the most common burnable poisons

$B_4C$ is a common compound  
Gadolinium and erbium are used too as oxides

Pyrex like my measuring cups are also used  
Borosilicate glass enclosed in steel tubes  
Can be inserted into existing guide tube locations in the assemblies  

Wet burnable absorber uses $Al_2O_3-B_4C$ encased in Zircaloy tube  
Coolant flows through  
Also installed in guide tubes
---
# Integral fuel absorber applies a coating on pellets

Uses $ZrB_2$

The idea is that this absorber does not displace coolant and reduce fission 

But boron produces He in the fuel rod, so I don't see how that doesn't affect structure

It seems like they build in a gap for the He to form
---
# Gadolinium pellets can be used in the fuel rods

$Gd_2O_3-UO_2$ with natural uranium

These are made into rods and inserted into assemblies

Does this seem like a weird way to design the reactor?
---
class: middle, center

# Fuel fabrication
---
# To make fuel, first convert $UF_6$ to $UO_2$

Enriched $UF_6$ is delivered as a solid  
Heated so that it sublimates

Reacted with water as: $UF_6+2H_2O \rightarrow UO_2F_2+4HF$ in solution   
Mixed with ammonia: $2UO_2F_2+6NH_4OH \rightarrow (NH_4)_2U_2O_7+3H_2O$

Calcined with air with to produce $U_3O_8$  
Reduced with hydrogen to obtain $UO_2$  powder  
This is basically the same process from last time

Pressed into pellets and sintered (24 h)
---
class: middle, center

![areva](img/areva.jpg)
---
# Pellets then loaded into rods

Backfilled with helium

Where do we get the helium?

Welded shut

PWR pressurized to 2000 psi; BWR 1000 psi

Etched in nitric hydrofluoric acid

Autoclaved with high pressure steam to develop corrosion resistant film
---
# Rods are bundled together into assemblies

[<img align="left" src="img/assembly.jpg">](https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/81/162181-004-C9F17D1F.jpg)

Spaces for instrumentation and control rods

Typically, PWRs are 17 x 17 assemblies, but some are 15 x 15

12 feet tall 

For 1.1 GWe, 190 assemblies, 50,000 rods, 18 million pellets

BWRs use 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 because the rod goes in between assemblies

750 assemblies, 70,000 rods, 25 million pellets
---
# How many fuel related accidents have there been? 

Fuel swells because of fission product generation  
Pellets are beveled to have a gap in between them to provide margins

Pellet density can increase  
Volume decrease, where cladding could collapse  
Specifications require pore size distribution to avoid this

Thermal expansion causes deformation, but beveling can also avoid
---
# Cladding failures can release fission products

Fast power increase causes local stress due to pellet expansion  
Leading to cracking  
Fission product release can cause corrosion  

Hydrogen forms due to radiolysis  
Over $900^o C, Zr+2H_2O \rightarrow ZrO_2+2H_2$  
Why is this important?

Causes embrittlement of cladding
---
# How is fuel examined for defects?

During refueling - "sipping" which is a silly name

Assembly is placed in a sealed water-filled container  
Sample water for fission products  
2 - 5 per hour  

Alternatively, assemblies placed in dry container   
Elevated temperature environment will cause fission gas release if leaking  
Easier to detect fission gases

Most efficient is inducing a vaccuum  
Faster to detect  
Enhances fission gas release

# Pebble fuel
---
# Pebble fuel was envisioned for He cooled reactors

Dr. Rudolf Schulten in 1950s thought it up

SiC coated uranium 'kernels' with graphite spheres  

AVR reactor demonstrated concept  
1967-88 at 15 MWe  

Lots of accidents though   
Bypassed emergency shutdown  
Opertated at a loss (several million/year)
---
# AVR reached highest temperatures at $950^o C$

High temperature led to fuel instablilites  
Contaminated vessel with fission products  
Leaked into groundwater in 1978  

Reflector broke and trapped pebbles  
Vessel filled with concrete
---
# UCB working on salt cooled PBR

[<img src="img/pbfhr.png">](http://fhr.nuc.berkeley.edu/)
---
# Each pebble has 9 grams of fuel 

<img align="left" src="img/pebble.jpg">

Kernel can be uranium, thorium, plutonium oxides

Carbides
---
# Two ways to use pebble fuels

![TRISO](img/triso.jpg)
---
# Pebbles used for gas cooled reactors

High heat - $850^o C - 900^o C$  - hydrogen production

Can use pebbles or prism

We've seen the prism type at INL PIE

Thermal efficency > 40%

Graphite moderated

Requires ~20% enrichment  
Problem?
---
# Big advantage being able to run up to high temperatures

Up to $1800^o C$ fission products contained in TRISO pebble  
Defense-in-depth fuel design

Prism design has high mechanical strength

Low thermal gradients --> high thermal conductivity

Low thermal expansion

Graphite serves as heat sink for metal fission products

High outlet heat for Brayton cycle (high efficiency)  
Can use direct cycle gas turbine
---
# [TRISO](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/nuclear-fuels/) provides defense in depth design

Kernel is the fission energy - 100 GWD/MTU

Porous carbon buffer provide voids for fission gas generation  
Accomodates swelling

Inner PyC retains fission gases  
Mechanical substrate for SiC deposition

SiC primary containment for fission products and load bearing layer

Outer PyC provides compressive stress due to shrinking during irradiation  
Retains fission gas  
Bonding layer for fuel element matrix
---
# Fort St. Vrain in Co operated an HTGR 1979-89

He primary coolant  
Secondary water coolant for steam generators

Construction 1968  
Commercial power 1979  

Thermal efficiency 40%  
Load following  
90 GWD/MTU burnup

Combination of uranium and thorium  
Prismatic
---
# It cost relatively less that LWRs 

$200 million - 60 cents per watt

No need for zircalloy 

Less costly RPV  
No need for as heavy shielding as LWRs
---

# Operational issues rendered the concept problematic

Water lubricated seals infiltrated He lines and caused corrosion  
Some rod drives rusted, affecting shutdown  
Staff ignored moisture alarms

Electrical failures were costly  
Seemed linked to moisture infiltration

Resulted in a lot of shutdowns  
Economic loss

Plant was shut down in 1989 and decommissioned in 1992

# MOX
---
# We know used fuel is reprocessed by PUREX to make MOX

Pu-U ceramic oxide for use in LWRs  

Challenges are essentially the same as uranium oxides

Seven uranium oxide assemblies can produce one MOX assembly + vitrified waste  

35% of once-through volume, mass, disposal cost

Weapons grade Pu of 5% needed in MOX equivalent to 4.5% enriched U fuel  
Reactor grade Pu 7% - 11%; averages 9.5%
