## NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
### Reactor fuel design and fabrication 

#### 4
---
# Outcomes for the lecture

Chapter 4

Design different fuel concepts

Assess fule performance

Analyze fuel cost as a component in the fuel cycle
---
# What's the advantage of nuclear

Construction costs are really high  
Hopefully modularization will help reduce that

The real advantage is the high capacity factor

# Defense in depth used for fuel design

<img align="left" src="img/fuel.pin.jpg">

In LWRs  
Fuel matrix for structural integrity  
Material that won't melt 

Technically not really if LFTR

Cladding to protect fuel from coolant  
Can't melt either 

Must contain fuel and prevent fission product release in the event of fuel failure

We can talk about fuel for different reactors though
---
# Materials are the strongest design constraint

One reason why NuScale is so far ahead is because the fuel is the same

Other factors are  
reactivity  
heat transfer  
structural containment  
no neutron absorbers  
---
# Fuel has to be cost effective

Long residency in the core 

Standard design for ready production (use in a lot of reactors)

Reliability - transients

[Quality control](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/oversight/quality-assurance.html)

Technology-neutral

# Uranium fuel used as metal first

Zircaloy clad

[Any guesses where?](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/fuel-cycle-analysis/)

$UF_4+2Mg \rightarrow 2MgF_2+U$

We can also get it from electrorefining

Uranium metal has three allotropes
---
# $\alpha$ phase is stable up to 600C

<img align="left" src="img/orthorhombic.jpg">

Anisotropic

When heated, expands in two different directions and contracts in a third

Crystal structure highly asymmetrical

Only Mo and Nb form solid solutions

Do we know anyone working with U-Mo?
---
# $\beta$ phase is stable between 660C to 700C

<img align="left" src="img/tetragonal.png">

Also anisotropic

Both phases orient in preferred direction when metal is deformed

Brittle and hard
---
# $\gamma$ phase is stable from 760C to 1130C

<img align="left" src="img/bcc.png">

This is isotropic

Is this better to use?

Irradiation adversely affects thermal conductivity

How? 
---
# Commercial fuel in LWRs is $UO_2$ ceramic

<img align="left" src="img/UO2.jpg">

[Why?](http://www.pbs.org/program/rickover-birth-nuclear-power/)

Crystallizes in fluorite structure

Face centered cubic lattice

Oxygen in tetrahedral sites

[Phase diagram](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/geosciences/people/faculty/parise/Parise%20Website%201.png)
---
# $UO_2$ is used because oxygen has low neutron capture

Structurally very stable

Coolant is a harsh environment

Fission products stay trapped in the matrix

But that causes expansion of the fuel

High melting point $2865^o C$
---
class: center, middle

# What's the down side though
---
# Uranium oxide fuel isn't actually that great on heat transfer

Low thermal conductivity

[<img align="left" src="img/therm.png">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel#/media/File:ZrUthermalcond.png)

10 - 5 W/m/K

Surprisingly hard to find comparative data

[Figure 11](https://neup.inl.gov/SiteAssets/Final%20%20Reports/NEUP-Project-09-773-Final-Report.pdf)

High temperatures cause high thermal gradients

How is heat transferred to the coolant?
---
# High temperatures cause grain growth

<img align="left" src="img/grain.jpg">

Crystal lattice increase at high temperatures

But the fuel is constrained in the cladding

High temperatures disordered boundaries means that vacancies can diffuse rapidly   
Leading to rapid creep

Which leads to what?

Boundaries have high energy  
Nucleation - fission products
---
# Thermal gradients cause pellets to look like hourglass

<img align="left" src="img/voids.jpg">

Thermal stress can cause cracking

Voids form with fission gas

Migrate to grain boundaries

Fission gas can still be contained by the cladding
---
# Linear heat rate decreases with burnup

Less thermal expansion with irradation

Reduces the heat transfer with increasing core life of fuel

Couldn't find a graph for this though
---
# Fuel also grows with burnup

Actual growth due to anisotropy of crystal

Swelling from grain boundaries and FP gas formation

Pellet density decreases due to void formation

Neutrons knock atoms out of the lattice creating interstitials

Percent change in volume up to 0.7%

How does this affect fuel performance?

Other U ceramic fuels if there's time
---
# Fuel cladding serves many functions

Protects fuel from corrosion

Contains fission products

Facilitates heat transfer
---

class: middle, center 

# What are cladding design requirements?
---
# Stainless steel first used 

But that was for fast reactors

Absorption cross section is too high in thermal region

Zr and Be are the only metals with melting points about 1000C

Why not Be then?

Zr is always stuck with hafnium which has high neutron absorption

So more chemical processing to remove the hafnium

Zircaloy was developed for cladding ($1850^o C$ melting point)

Contains other elements Sn, Fe, Cr, Ni
---
# SiC melts at $2730^o C$

Robust in molten salts up to $800^o C$

Lower neutron absorption

Greater resistance to radiation damage

Problematic in terms of mechanical strength

It seems to me like we are too locked in to LWR paradigms
