## PRINCIPLES OF NUCLEAR ENGINEERING  
### Back end management

#### 6

# Outcomes for the lecture

Interpreting back end of the fuel cycle as an equal component with the front end

Explaining how physical processes in the repository work

Criticizing current back end 'policy'

From my NE224 course at UCB and UCB/Todai summer school 2009
---
## Back-end management is the most socially science based in the fuel cycle 

Some engineers tend to think the public is ignorant (generational)?

'Convincing them' is not a solution

Approaches, criteria, for engineering design are affected by social factors

But, to what extent should nuclear engineers understand social factors?

What is the role of engineers in social decision making process?

Third generation nuclear engineers need to be able to:  
Understand the social system correctly  
Listen to the public  
Develop engineering options to explore optimized solution for the people
---
# Building the reactors is easy

What's the difference between the AP1000 and French EPR?

The point is to standardize reactor designs for efficient deployment

What's the difference between Yucca Mountain and Onkalo?

Repositories are variable across nations and the world

Acceptance for siting is complex
---
# There are different kinds of nuclear waste

**High-level waste**  
Unreprocessed spent fuel assemblies  
Highly radioactive primary waste stream from reprocessing (containing virtually all fissionproducts and most transuranics except plutonium)  

**Transuranic waste**  
Non-high-level waste contaminated with long-lived transuranics above 100 nanocuries per gram

**Uranium mill tailings**  
Residues from uranium mining and milling operations containing low concentrations of naturally occurring radioactive materials
---
**Low level waste**  
All non-high-level, non-TRU wastes; wide variation in physical and chemical forms, activity levels, etc (gloves, etc.)

**Wastes from decontamination and decommissioning**  
Waste contaminated with small amounts or radioactivity from D&D (mostly LLW)

**Mixed waste**  
Contains both radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals

**Effluents**  
Contaminated materials below ‘de minimus’ levels permitting direct discharge to environment

# What are the options to dispose of nuclear waste?
---
# What are the technical limitations of these options?

Near surface engineered storage (LLW)  
Geologic repository  
Deep borehole (perhaps for iodine)  
Ice sheet disposal   

Sub seabed disposal

Spaaaaaacceeeee!

The National Academy of Science judged geologic repositories to be the way waste should be disposed

What do you need to know to dispose the waste in the repository?
---
# Waste disposal was thought about from the start

Commercial nuclear development followed Eisenhower's [Atoms for Peace speech](https://youtu.be/2B8R-umE0s0) in 1953

Mid-50s: US made a decision to take naval nuclear reactor technology and apply it to commercial generation of electrical power using civilian owned reactors

First commercial nuclear power plant was at Shippingport PA  
United States was reprocessing nuclear fuel materials until Carter

1955: National Academy of Sciences was asked what to do about waste 

1957: Disposal in cavities mined in salt is suggested as the possibility promising the most practical immediate solution of the problem
---
## Waste management is a failure because it was not treated as a social problem (imo)

NAS in 1957 recommended deep disposal in salt

Lyons Kansas was investigated 1957-72, but scrapped due to public opposition

WIPP authorized in 1980 and received waste first in 1999  
Zero accidents recorded, in that period, not counting the moron who lost his badge when we were there 

WIPP = TRU waste (from weapons program) only (1992)

1972: U.S. Atomic Energy Commission abandons repository project at a salt mine in Lyons, KA. Promotes Retrievable Surface Storage Facility (RSSF) as 100-year interim solution
---
## Continuing waste management history

1975: RSSF abandoned. Geologic disposal adopted as preferred alternative

1977: Spent fuel reprocessing indefinitely deferred

1982: Nuclear Waste Policy Act lays out comprehensive screening process leading to 2 sites in West and East; establishes Nuclear Waste Fund, financed by 0.1 cent/kWh nuclear electricity levy; directs DOE to begin accepting spent fuel from utilities in 1998

That Nuclear Waste Fund has a lot of money now

1985: President Reagan abandons site search in east

1987: Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments direct DOE to focus all site investigation at Yucca Mountain, NV; ended 2nd repository screening activity 
---
## Continuing waste management history

1987: NV opposes DOE site characterization and lose in court

1998: DOE ‘Viability Assessment’ finds no technical ‘showstoppers’ to proceeding with Yucca Mountain site

1999: DOE issues Draft Environmental Impact Statement concluding that disposal at Yucca Mountain would be safer than leaving the waste where it is.

2002: President approves proceeding with YM as nation’s first repository

Senate majority leader is from NV now, but is resigning 

Complex national geologic repository site selection process initiated, then abandoned

Yucca Mountain picked instead
---
## Continuing waste management history

DOE contracts with utilities to take possession of utility spent fuel beginning in 1998, but fails to do so.

Leaks of high-level radioactive waste from tanks at DOE sites in Washington and South Carolina.

Disclosures of contamination and excessive radiation doses to workers throughout DOE nuclear complex over a period of decades.

Continuing conflict between federal, state, and local jurisdictions over siting, regulatory issues
---
# Yucca mountain is not going to be a waste repository

Disposing used fuel is a wasted resource

Reprocessing is a sound technology that has half a century of operational history

And reduces waste volume

Current onsite storage in dry casks is relatively secure

A consolidated interim storage facility enhances security and physical protection
---
## Why not build an industrial park where the used fuel is stored and reprocessed? (jobs, economic growth)

Cons  
Will become a de facto alternative to disposal (write into law that it cannot be like WIPP, or give authority to State to make decsion)  
Will be no easier to site than a repository (Yucca mountain is already there and built)  
Will reduce momentum to develop a repository (everyone agrees we need one)

Back end management needs to be treated as a social problem or there will be no success

# What do you do with the fuel when you take it out of the reactor?

Either the used fuel is reprocessed or disposed

But there is always going to be some high-level waste

High-level waste = highly radioactive, some long-lived, toxic

So far in USA, used fuel is stored in the pool and in dry casks

What’s the problem with keeping the spent fuel just lying around?
---
# Why not just hang onto waste until we figure out something better?

Ethics, which is not nearly taken into consideration enough

...from an ethical standpoint, including long-term safety considerations, our responsibilities to future generations are better discharged by a strategy of final disposal than by reliance on stores which require surveillance, bequeath long-term responsibilities of care, and may in due course be neglected by future societies whose
structural stability should not be presumed...

The Environmental and Ethical Basis of Geological Disposal of Long-Lived Radioactive Wastes, OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (1995)
---
## Nuclear waste policy act (1982) is the basis for HLW management in USA

Established disposal in geologic formation

DOE sites, constructs, operates

Sites studied: Hanford, Yucca Mountain, Texas

Amendment in 1987: only Yucca Mountain (70000 MTHM)
Supposed to start in 1998

A license application was submitted to NRC in 2008  
Obama Administration withdrew any further funding  
(Thanks, Obama)

The status of the application was locked up in legal actions
---
## Nuclear waste policy act (1982) is the basis for HLW management in USA

2013: Circuit Court ruled for NRC to continue safety evaluation
2016: EIS completed in 2016

But what happens if the license is granted?

So woefully behind the rest of the world
---
## [Blue ribbon commission](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/brc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf) was established to deal with waste management policy

New approach to siting (i.e., one that might actually work)

Potential federal corporation for waste management (Europe)

Consolidated interim storage facilities

So what’s so important about these?

Stakeholders
---
## The Energy Policy Act (1992) set regulatory framework

40CFR197: EPA radioactivity releases  
Individual protection standard   
Groundwater protection standard   
Human intrusion standard  

No greater than 15 mrem per year for the maximally-exposed individual during first 10000 years  
(National average background is 300 mrem)  

Parameters describing human activity and behavior 'will remain as there are today'
---
## The Energy Policy Act (1992) set regulatory framework

NRC verifies compliance with performance assessments, risk-informed approach

10CFR63: Construction, operation, closure, 15 mrem limit

NAS review in 1995  
Extended time frame of peak risk to 1 million years  
(of adverse health effects)  
---
## The Energy Policy Act (1992) had NAS to review the whole issue of disposal

Can scientifically justifiable analyses of repository behavior over many thousands of years in the future be made?

Recommended the use of a standard that sets a limit on the risk to individuals of adverse
health effects from releases from the repository is recommended

Extension of time frame from 10000 to a million years

Based on long term stability of the geologic environment
---
class: center,middle

# Functional components and technical basis
---
# A conceptual process model is the basis for performance assessment

Waste cannot be released to biosphere at unacceptable concentrations

Waste must be removed and isolated from catastrophic natural events or human activity*

Must be able to use current technology and engineering at reasonable cost

Widely acceptable performance assessment modeling

*Into Eternity
---
# Waste is inevitably going to get out

Contain (isolate) waste as long as possible  
Maintain engineered barrier system for 1E5+ years

Physically isolated in a matrix/waste form (vitrified glass)  
Then put that in a canister

During containment, we rely on decay to wipe out most of the radionuclides (at least 300 years)  
Which are the two most important in the near term?

Engineers generally agree that maintaining integrity to about 1000 years is possible

When waste does get out, we want controlled release and dispersal based on natural processes
---
## Controlled release = multi barrier concept (risk assessment approach)

Multi barrier concept aka defense in depth  
Very common approach in all fields of risk assessment  
Redundancy and diversity  
Common examples of this?

For the repository, a series of engineered and natural barriers  
Multi barrier is an holistic concept  
Act in concert  
Delay and decay

Host rock  
Groundwater  
---
## Controlled release = multi barrier concept (risk assessment approach)

Waste form  
Canister  
Backfill  

Should not have common failure modes  
Same as with reactor safety  

Risk-informed approach --> NRC paradigm for reactors  

Same for my research  
Widely accepted way of doing things  
---
# Delay and decay means contain and extend transport

If containment time is 10x greater than half life, then all set

Containment for 300 to 1000 y is effective in eliminating Co-60, Sr-90, Cs-137

Repository will also approach ambient temperature by this time  
Which is beneficial why?

Non sorbing radionuclides are problematic though

Similarly if transport time is greater than 10x half life, then all set

Want diffusion to dominate over advection   
How? Why?
---
## How are multi barriers applied to repository design?

Waste package is the waste form and canister  
Resistant to leaching by groundwater, chemically and physically

Backfill  
Placed around everything once its put in there  
Inhibits groundwater movement  
Chemically inhibitive, clay is negatively charged, radionuclides are postively

Geologic structure  
Isolates waste from humans and doggys (boo, cats)  
Chemically, mechanically stable

What challenges would Japan face in this context?
---
## How are multi barriers applied to repository design?

Prevents/restricts circulating groundwater

## Each country legally responsible for waste management and disposal

All saturated

Most all have the quasi-federal companies

Do we have similar formations in the USA?

What is the best formation?

# Siting is a decade(s) long process

Assuming a locality volunteers  
Public acceptance, both local and national  
In USA, we have extra layer of state government

Assure long term stability

**Geology**  
Structurally stable geological block (such as?)  
Not near a tectonic boundary  
Avoid faults along which rupture could occur  
Avoid areas with abnormally high geothermal  
Gradients or with evidence of relatively recent volcanic activity  
Mechanical properties should assure stability during operation   
---
Competing land use like parks, oil, gas  
Transportation requirements 

**Hydrology**  
Fluid transport should not move hazardous material to the biosphere in amounts and rates above prescribed limits  
Low permeability  
Low flow

System should be capable of being sealed when the repository is closed 

Geological record should support predictions favorable for long-term hydrological isolation of the repository site in a perturbed geological environment

Most places in Europe are not like that
---
**Geochemistry**  
Heat, radiation should not produce physical, chemical reactions in the rock that would compromise containment  
Low oxygen  
Low redox potential (Eh)  
Near neutral pH  
Low concentrations of complexing anions and organics (why?)  

Conditions should minimize the rate of dissolution of the waste form (typically reducing)

Water in the repository  should not react to increase permeability  
Limit mobility of radionuclides and delay or prevent their migration to the biosphere

No area with record of resource extraction  
Where does Japan and Korea site their repositories then?
---
class: center,middle

# How long is long term?  

# What are the oldest human constructed formations?
---
## Multiple barriers are engineered to provide defense in depth

This is the basis for any risk management approach

What actually happens in the repository?

The whole point is that after everything gets put in you close the repository and walk away

It is supposed to function on its own

Why?

Limit exposures in the long term

Compliance demonstrated by the performance assessment
---
# Know your materials science

Corrosion resistant metals with inert oxide surface layer
Low rate of corrosion in water
Advanced materials

New alloy made for Yucca Mountain

Compatible with repository environment

Buffer assures slow diffusion and high sorption
Diffusion dominated transport
Long transit time, delay and decay (show TRIBEX graphs)
Constrain corrosion rate
Seal fractures due to construction

Saturated repositories use bentonite
Each has different chemical make up Na+, Ca++ interlayer ions (show picture)

For unsaturated conditions, use sand over gravel
---
# Other processes to consider

Thermal management

Subcritical configuration

Waste form dissolution

Diffusion

Solubility

Corrosion
---
# What is each barrier expected to do?

**Geologic formation**  
isolate EBS from biosphere  
geomechanical stability  
favorable geochemistry  
limit groundwater flow

**Backfill**  
contain EBS  
limit fast release pathways  
mechanical stability of tunnels
---
# What is each barrier expected to do?

**Buffer**  
diffusive dominated transport  
isolate canister from formation  
conduct heat

**Canister**  
isolate waste for long time period  
mechanical stability  
conduct heat  
---
## Repository design is a combination of engineering design 
variables with characteristics of the natural system

Readily available technologies

Possible retrievability

Based on well accepted models

We want to use what we know well so we are confident in results

Risk informed approach

Environmental modeling
---
## Waste must be contained ‘as long as necessary’

This depends on making a robust waste form Borosilicate glass or ceramic matrix

‘Long enough’ so most radionuclide decay away ~1000 years

Significant heat comes from $^{137}Cs$ and $^{90}Sr$ (about 30 y for both)  
So how long before it is considered decayed?

Actinides like Pu, Cm, etc., are long lived, but low radioactivity

They are really toxic though because they are heavy metals

Oxidation state of Np makes it very mobile

Iodine is a negative ion so also very mobile
---
## When there is release, it must be diluted and dispersed

Clay can trap the radionuclides (+/- charges)

A lot of water can dilute the contaminant plume
---
## The multi-barrier concept is a series of engineered and natural barriers to delay release

Not common failure mode

Waste form (dissolution and solubility modeling)  
Waste container

Buffer (Diffusion of radionuclides, sorption)  
Backfill (Same)

Geological structure: requires decades long studies  
(Diffusion, dispersion, advection, sorption modeling, ion exchange)
