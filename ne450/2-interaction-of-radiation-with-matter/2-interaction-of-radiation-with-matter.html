### Gamma rays interact with matter in very complicated ways
#### Fortunately for us we only need to know three
---
class: center,middle

# Photoelectric effect
---
## The photoelectric effect occurs when a high energy photon knocks out an electron

Interacts with entire atom

Electron ejected

Leaves a positively charged ion

Usually an x ray emission

Atom recoil carries little KE

Highly probable with heavier atoms

Why?
---
class: center,middle
![pe](img/pe.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

# Pair production
---
## For pair production, a high energy photon creates a negatron and positron

Only occurs with photon above 1.022 MeV  
Near the nucleus  
Why?

Then they react with other negatrons/positrons

Give off characteristic 0.511 MeV photons

Only in vicinity of Coulomb field
---
class: center,middle
![pp](img/pp.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

# Compton effect
---
## The Compton effect is elastic scattering of a photon by an electron

Energy and momentum are conserved

All angles of scattering possible

![scatter equation](img/scattering.eq.jpg)

Should be able to derive maximum energy from this equation

CE causes problems with shielding - Why?

Talk about NE class experiment at WPI
---
class:center, middle
![scatter diagram](img/scattering.jpg)

class: center,middle

## Fission
---
## What is the energy of fission from thorium and uranium fuel cycles?

![U235 fission](img/fission_u235.jpg)

![U233 fission](img/fission_u233.jpg)

### $Q = 173.3 \; MeV, \; 185.4 \; MeV$

For comparison, burning a carbon atom releases 4 eV

Some super heavy nuclei fission spontaneously
---
## Fission is the splitting of atoms, which releases a lot of energy

![fission](img/fission.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

## Neutron interactions
---
## Neutrons will pass through electron cloud and react directly with the nucleus

Why?

![u235 compound](img/u235.compound.jpg)

Sometimes the compound nucleus is left in an excited state, before the reaction proceeds, but this can be a very short time

What happens is highly dependent on neutron energy/temp

So you do not always write the compound nucleus in the reaction expression
---
class: center,middle

[![compound nucleus](img/compound.jpg)](http://www.citycollegiate.com/fissionXb.gif)
---
## There are several ways neutrons interact with nuclei

1. Elastic scattering (probably most important)

2. Inelastic scattering

3. Radiative capture/neutron absorption

4. Charged-particle reactions

5. Neutron producing reactions

![neutron interaction equations](img/neutron.eqs.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

# Elastic scattering
---
## With elastic scattering, the neutron strikes the nucleus, and they scatter (n,n)

If you’ve ever played pool (billiards), it’s that sort of

But the neutron is a lot smaller than the nucleus

Kinetic energy and momentum is conserved with nucleus and neutron
---
## With elastic scattering, the neutron strikes the nucleus, and they scatter

![neutron elastic scattering](img/neutron.elastic.scattering.jpg)
---
## With elastic scattering, the neutron strikes the nucleus, and they scatter (n,n)

Nucleus can be at rest or moving, but neutron velocity is really faster

So basically the nucleus is ‘at rest’
---
## The neutron energy after the collision can be obtained by conservation principles

<img align="left" src="img/neutron.elastic.scattering2.jpg">

### $E=E^{'}+E_A$  

### $\vec{p}=\vec{p}^{'}+\vec{P}$

#### $E^{'}=\frac{E_n}{(A+1)^2} \cdot [cos \theta \sqrt{A^2-sin^2 \theta}]^2$

### $\alpha \equiv (\frac{A-1}{A+1})^2$

(p58-9) - but in any edition
---
class: center,middle

# Lethargy
---
## The concept of lethargy was invented for neutron moderation

They aren't good at naming things

### $u \equiv ln \frac{E_M}{E}$

$E_M$ is the highest neutron energy in the system

What is happening mathematically?
---
## The concept of lethargy was invented for neutron moderation

So, lethargy increases when neutron slows down

Log scale is used because neutrons have huge energy range
---
## What we really want is average log energy loss per elastic scatter/collision

### $\xi \equiv 1+\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}ln \alpha$

### $\alpha \equiv (\frac{A-1}{A+1})^2$

Average change in lethargy

What does this tell us?

In terms of thermal reactor design?
---
## Because elastic scattering can be applied to find out how a neutron will slow down

### $\overline{n}_{COL} \equiv \frac{1}{\xi} ln \frac{E_1}{E_2}$

What is the physical interpretation?

Moderation = getting high energy neutrons to low energy

This means from fast moving to slow

Why? This is a very fundamental reactor design constraint
---
class: center,middle

# Inelastic scattering
---
### With inelastic scattering, it is the same as elastic, but the nucleus is left in excited state (n,n’)

<img align="left" src="img/inelastic.scattering.jpg">

Then the nucleus emits gamma rays  

Occurs above a certain neutron energy for each nucleus  

A neutron with same energy may not scatter with different nuclei  
Energy is lower for heavier nuclei  

Kinetic energy and momentum **not** conserved  
Compound nucleus emits lower energy neutron  
---
class: center,middle

# Radiative capture
---
### With radiative capture, the neutron is captured by the nucleus and gamma rays are emitted (n,gamma)

This is important with reactor design (fission and fusion)

Take a guess why?

We also call this neutron absorption in this context

Usually a low energy neutron reaction (why?)

Depends on neutron energy and material 

Other applications include NAA, isotope production
---
class: center,middle

![capture](img/capture.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

# Charged particle emission
---
## The nucleus can also absorb a neutron and emit a charged particle (n,alpha), (n,p), etc.

This can be used to design neutron detectors

Part of fusion reactions

Boron is used as neutron ‘poison’ and can absorb low energy (reactors, BNCT)

Materials testing for fuel cladding (fusion and fission)

Charged particle production could be adverse

Neutron depth profiling; surface of semiconductors, etc.

![charged particle](img/charged.particle.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

# Bremsstrahlung radiation
---
## A consequence of charged particle reactions is the Bremsstrahlung radiation

Deceleration of the charged particle through matter

A photon is emitted from interaction with the electron cloud or nucleus with the charged particle

The moving particle loses energy and this is in the form of a photon

aka 'braking radiation'

Continuous radiation distribution

Can be used to identify galaxy clusters

Only one page in the text but it is important to know
---
class: center,middle

# Cross sections 
---
## A cross section tells us basically the probability of an interaction (with something)

Neutrons for us

Cross sections for other events like PE, Compton

People dedicate careers to establishing precise cross sections (and good for them)

Cross sections are given as a hypothetical area  around the target nucleus (big area, high probability)

### $1 \; b = 10^{-24} cm^2$

Dependent on speed/energy/temperature
---
## Try to think of this as the likelihood of interaction

[![cross section](img/cross.section.jpg)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Cross-section-illustration-simple.svg)

Since there is a lot of space in between nuclei, some neutrons just fly by

Radius of a nucleus $\sim 10^{-12} \; cm^2$, so cross section is $\sim 10^{-24} cm^2$  
Which is where they derived barns 

Probability of interaction is the ratio of the total surface area of the atoms to the total area of the medium
---
class: center,middle

## So how does cross section vary with temperature?

### What is physically happening?
---
## Fission cross sections have this general trend

<img align="left" src="img/u235.fission.cross.section.jpg">

If fission neutrons start at 2 MeV, where would you want them for a reactor?
---
class: center,middle

# Neutron density
---
## Neutron density in the thermal region follows Maxwellian distribution

As fast neutrons slow down, they eventually come into thermal equilibrium with the thermal motion of the atoms in the medium through which they are moving

Also called the 1/v region

Resonances occur if the compound nucleus is produced in one of its characteristic excited states

And the fast end is a smooth region
---
class: center,middle

## $n(E) = n_0 \frac{2\pi\sqrt{E}}{(\pi kT)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \cdot e^{-\frac{E}{kT}}$

## $n(v) = n_0 \frac{4\pi v^2}{(\frac{2\pi kT}{m})^{\frac{3}{2}}} \cdot e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}}$
---
## How does this affect reactor operation?

![capture cross section](img/capture.cross.section.jpg)
---
![pu239 cross section](img/pu239.cross.section.jpg)
---
## How do you choose materials?

<a href="https://sites.wrk.ru/sites/org/wi/wikimedia/upload/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Common_light_element_moderators,_reflectors_and_absorbers.svg/760px-Common_light_element_moderators,_reflectors_and_absorbers.svg.png" style="float: left"> <img src="img/moderators.jpg"></a>

solid = scatter

dotted = absorption
---
class: center,middle

# Neutron fluence
---
## How many neutrons/s that strike a target actually interact with target nuclei?

<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/crosec.html" style="float: left"> <img src="img/flux.jpg"></a>

$I[\frac{n}{cm^2 \cdot s}]=[\frac{n}{cm^3}] \cdot v[\frac{cm}{s}]$

$[\frac{n}{cm^3}] \cdot v[\frac{cm}{s}] \cdot a[cm^2]=\frac{n}{s}$   

$nuclei_{tar} \equiv N[\frac{nuclei}{cm^3}] \cdot a[cm^2] \cdot L[cm]$  

$\frac{interactions}{s} \equiv (\sigma I)(NaL)$

So, the cross section is the probability the neutron interacts with the nucleus

Section 3.2, example 3.1
---
## Then we can define the mean free path

First, macroscopic cross section is 

### $\Sigma [cm^{-1}] N \sigma = \frac{\rho N_A}{A}$ 

Then mean free path is 

### $\lambda \equiv \Sigma^{-1} [cm]$

Expected value of distance between interactions

Then the interaction rate is 

### $R_X = \phi \Sigma_X$
---
class: center,middle

# Neutron flux
---
<img align="left" src="img/shielding.jpg">

Which flux is larger?

Point source

Isotropic
---
## Uncollided flux decreases exponentially with distance

### $-d\phi = \Sigma_t \phi dx$

### $-\frac{d\phi}{\phi} = \Sigma_t dx$  
Probability a neutron interacts in dx

### $\phi(x) = \phi_0 e^{-\Sigma_t x}$  
Probability a neutron does not interact in x
---
## It's the same for gamma rays

Shielding is material density dependent

### $\phi(x) = \phi_0 e^{-\mu x}$

Look up the mass attenuation coefficient

### $\frac{\mu}{\rho} [\frac{cm^2}{g}]$

Then just multiply mass attentuation by material density
