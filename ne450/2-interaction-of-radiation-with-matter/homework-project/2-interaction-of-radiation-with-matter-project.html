# NE450: Principles of nuclear engineering 
## Project 2
### Nuclear engineering basics
####[200]

<p>
1. [20]  Derive the elastic scattering energy equation for neutrons.

<p>
2. [10] Based on this, derive the minimum and maximum scattered neutron energies.

<p>
3. [10] Derive the average energy of the scattered neutron and the average energy loss.

<p>
4. [10] Find the limit of $\alpha$ with increasing A. What are the implications?

<p>
5. [10] Do the same for average fractional energy loss versus $\alpha$.

<p>
6. [10] Based on this, what materials are more attractive for slowing down neutrons and why?

<p>
7. [10] Plot $\xi$ versus A. What are the major observations and implications?

<p>
8. [20] Derive $\xi$. Apply the definition of [expected value for a continuous random variable](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-riskassessment/chapter/statistical-moments/) and the probability distribution per unit energy loss. [_The probability distribution can just be looked up and not derived, but please explain the functional behavior._]

<p>
9. [10] Plot the average number of collisions versus A for a 2 MeV neutron slowing down to 0.025 MeV, for water, boron, carbon, sodium, and uranium. Comment on the results.

<p>
10. [10] Is an inelastic scattering endothermic or exothermic? Please explain why. Similarly, is radiative capture endothermic or exothermic? [_Show with math_.]

<p>
11. [15] Why is boron an attractive neutron capture material?

<p>
12. [15] Compute and plot the mean free path for scattering and absorption versus mass for water, boron, carbon, sodium, and uranium and comment on the results. How does this compare to #9?

<p>
13. [10] Derive and compute the most probable energy and velocity for thermal (1/v) neutrons.

<p>
14. [10] Derive and compute mean energy and velocity of thermal (1/v) neutrons.

<p>
15. [30] Consider two Ar filled rooms of 10 m wide (x) by 20 m long (y). A neutron source is located at the midpoint of the eastern room. A concrete wall of x thickness separates the two rooms. How thick should the wall be to reduce the flux at the detector on the far western wall to 1%? What would be the thicknesses for a lead-lined, concrete wall? Roughly compare the costs for each shielding material by deriving a cost function. Consider only scattering and absorption.
