# What is this course about?

1. What is nuclear engineering?

2. What kind of work is done?

NE450 sets the table for success in the nuclear engineering department at the University of Idaho

The course is research driven and focused on developing transferable skills

Research is a higher level of learning

# What to get out of the course

Understanding nuclear engineering problems  

Developing skills to solve them - scientific computing concepts, critical thinking, neutronics modeling, writing

You're adults. You get what you put in. 
---
# Workload - 3 credit course

How much time do you think you'll put in each week?

Assignments usually require outside research

Collaboration is encouraged because that is what happens in the real world

Everyone hands in their own assignments though

**REQUIRED**  
Email homework as pdf to *gmail address* with NE450 in the subject title  

I try to have a fast turnaround with grading

# Textbook requirements

Introduction to nuclear engineering, John R. Lamarsh, ISBN 0-201-14200-7 (1983).   

Fundamentals of nuclear science and engineering, J. Kenneth Shultis, Richard E. Faw, ISBN 0-8247-0834-2 (2002).   

Nuclear chemical engineering, M. Benedict, T. H. Pigford, H. W. Levi, ISBN 0-07-004531-3 (1981). 

NE450 is based on Lamarsh  
Any version/edition is ok - Try not to spend too much

Other textbooks are just for additional reference

No specific reading assignments but it's expected you're reasonably prepared for each class period
---
## Pedagogical approach

Context based learning

That means 'student-driven'

Talking at you isn't the best use of our time

Homework presentations for each class

Regular participation is expected
---
# Class management 

[Piazza](piazza.com/uidaho/fall2020/ne450/home) will contain all the course materials

We also use this for discussion outside of class 

This is a very good platform for a nontraditional student body

Don't email class questions

Someone else might have the same question

Someone else might have a better answer than me
---
# MCNP

MCNP is a WIDELY used computational tool in nuclear engineering for literally anything you can think of

Our goal is to gain [facility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDoctorRAB/igem/master/neutronics-shielding/high-burnup/H-5060/guide-assembly/bare/air/air-backfill/50wt/30wt/12cm/inp/single.assembly_7815.inp) with [it](https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/kbjsrzm65to4ul/kc28c768t2n1c) 

Many many many students who have learned it in NE450 have leveraged that for internships

It's free, but export controlled 

Please go to [RSICC](https://rsicc.ornl.gov/) and request MCNP6.2 (I think)

You need to register for an account, and they use that for your license
---
# Prerequisites

Assumed you've had most engineering courses (linear algebra, statics, etc.)

I am not teaching these subjects

Differential equations - just Laplace transform and standard models

Learn a real graphing program - **NO EXCEL GRAPHS**

VLab has some software 

Use my python [all in one](https://github.com/TheDoctorRAB/plot/blob/master/src/general/plot_all.in.one_general.py) graphing code if you want for windows

Use [this one](https://github.com/TheDoctorRAB/plot/blob/master/src/igem/plot_all.in.one_cask.thickness_dose.rate.py) for linux

Math is going to be done. Being able to describe phenomena with math is important skill in research.

# Learning modules

**1. Fundamental nuclear physics**  
Atomic structure  
Radiation  
Radioactive decay  
Subatomic particles   
Half-life



---
Nuclear energetics  
Radioactivity  
Binary nuclear reactions  
Radiation interactions with matter  
Detection and measurement of radiation  
Radiation doses and risk assessment  
Monte Carlo simulation  
Principles of nuclear reactors and nuclear power  
Nonproliferation and nuclear weapons  
---
## Aristotle also had something to say about engineering education apparently

**Techne**  
Human skill based on a set of principles derived from practices and capable of being taught 

**Epistme**  
Knowledge, which consists of knowing why or knowing that 

**Praxis**  
The end of which is realized in the very doing of the activity

**Phronesis**  
Practical wisdom
