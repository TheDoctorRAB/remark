# NE450: Principles of nuclear engineering 
## Project 5
### Monte Carlo methods and MCNP
####[450]

<p>
For problems 1 - 3 use Monte Carlo techniques to obtain the solutions.  

<p>
1. [30] Solve for G using Monte Carlo techniques. Solve the integral analytically and graph g(x). Also plot G v N for $N=10,10^2,10^3,10^4,10^5,10^6$ or until the solution converges.

$G=\int_0^1 g(x)dx$

$g(x)=1-e^{-x}$

<p>
2. [30] Do the same for the following function. This g(x) does not have an analytical solution. However, you can use another numerical solver to compare the Monte Carlo result. 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;\LARGE&space;G&space;=&space;\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}sin(x^2)dx" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\LARGE&space;G&space;=&space;\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}sin(x^2)dx" title="\LARGE G = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}sin(x^2)dx" /></a>

<p>
3. [30] Approximate $\sqrt{2}$ in a similar manner to the way we approximated $\pi$.

<p>
4. [50] Conduct a short modeling study of the metal fuel alloy for the hot cell facility using 

[4_ff.alloy.inp (flux)](https://github.com/TheDoctorRAB/mcnpx.decks/blob/master/neutron.flux/input/4_ff.alloy.inp)  

and  

[4d_ff.alloy.inp (dose)](https://github.com/TheDoctorRAB/mcnpx.decks/blob/master/neutron.flux/input/4d_ff.alloy.inp).

<p>
1. Modify the facility to only include the SE and SW cells.   

<p>
2. Use MCNP to compute the volume averaged (F4) flux tallies for the SE cell and SW cell.   

Use a neutron emission rate of $1.1 \times 10^7 n/s/g$ for 24 g of material. Increase NPS from the original files to reduce standard error. 

<p>
3. Start with a wall thickness of 15 cm using the material already included in the deck. It is a form of borated concrete that is common to these kinds of facilities. Increase the wall thickness until the dose rate falls below 1 $\mu Sv/h$ and the relative flux falls below 0.01. 

<p>
4. Plot the dose rate $\mu Sv/h$ versus wall thickness and the ‘relative flux’; i.e., SW tally/SE tally versus wall thickness. 

Is this wall thickness reasonable? As in, could a facility be practically built like this using current engineering design techniques? Include the mcnp file at the end in an appendix. 

<p>
For the criticality models:  
<p>
1. Include a screenshot of the model from the Vised/plotter.

<p>
2. Include the input deck

<p>
3. Report the final table: $k_{EFF}$, standard deviation, 68% confidence, 95% confidence, 99% confidence

<p>
4. Use finite geometries

<p>
5. For criticality, try to get to 4 9s or 0s (.9999x, 1.0000x) for the mean, and 68% confidence; 3 9s,0s for each remaining confidence interval. 

<p>
6. Design geometries that will minimize leakage. Show (as part of making the mcnp file and results; not calculating by hand) that leakage has been minimized. 

<p>
7. Include the mcnp input file at the end of the report in an appendix. 

<p>
PROTIP - k can vary weird when your trying to get the critical radius to 4 or 5 decimal places. Study the KCODE parameters. You could also add more particles on KSRC, but be careful where you place them. 

<p>
5. [20] What is the critical mass of a bare sphere of plutonium containing (1) 95.5% $^{239}Pu$ and (2) 80% $^{239}Pu$? Where the rest is $^{238}Pu$.

<p>
6. [20] What is the critical mass for the above, but with a thin nickel shell of 0.10 cm?

<p>
7. [20] What is the critical mass of pure $^{239}Pu$ of a bare cylinder? 

<p>
8. [30] Taking the bare sphere $^{239}Pu$ geometry, what is the optimal reflector that minimizes the critical mass?

<p>
9. [30] Do the same for the bare sphere of $^{235}U$.

<p>
10. [30] And for $^{233}U$.

<p>
11. [20] Which reflector material is minimal and why, neutronically speaking?

<p>
12. [50] Geometry challenge. 

This is from the [MCNP benchmark document](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/mcnp/): Three unreflected aluminum cylinders contain $U(93.2) O_2 F_2$ water solutions. 

The inside cylinder diameter and critical height measured 20.3 cm and 41.4 cm. The aluminum container had a density of $2.71 g/cm^3$ and was 0.15 cm thick. 

The three cylinders were set in an equilateral configuration with a surface separation of 0.38 cm. The solution concentration parameters were $0.090 g ^{235}U/cm^3$ and a hydrogen to $^{235}U$ atomic ratio of 309. 

Given this data, it was estimated that the solution density was approximately $1.131 g/cm^3$ and consisted of $0.0021345 ^{235}U$, $0.00015382 ^{238}U$, $0.33383 O$, $0.65930 H$, and $0.0045756 F$ in atoms/b-cm. 

MCNP calculated $k = 0.9991 \pm 0.0011$. 

_(Try to get close)._

<p>
13. [20] Find the critical mass for a bare cylinder of 10.9% enriched U with a density of 18.63 g/cc.

<p>
14. [20] Find the minimum critical mass for an infinite graphite reflected U sphere with 93.5% U. Use 18.8 g/cc for the U density and just use carbon for the graphite.

<p>
15. [20] Find the critical mass of 97.67% enriched U cube in an infinite water reflector. Use a density of 18.794 g/cc.
