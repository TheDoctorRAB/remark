# Learning objectives

Demonstrating how the nuclear fuel cycle is an holistic system

Explaining why the nuclear fuel cycle is what it is

Some of Chapter 4 in the book

Read [The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Waste, Risk, and Economics](http://nature.berkeley.edu/er100/lectures/L16-Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle%20copy.pdf)

Check out [Pandora's promise](http://pandoraspromise.com/) if it's still on Netflix

There's a lot of pictures here

## Look at the fuel cycle from systems engineering pov

Mining

Making the fuel (saw Areva plant in Richland)

What a reactor does and the different kinds

Recycling (what kinds and how)

Back-end management (storage and disposal)

The fuel cycle has a lot of technical but institutional issues too

How are they functionally dependent? 
---
## The fuel used in the commercial reactors is $UO_2$ or $ (Pu+U)O_2$

<img src=img/cycle.components.jpg align="left">

**Front end:** making the fuel and putting it in the reactor

**Back end:** what happens when you take it out of the reactor
---
## We have to find uranium first - [$U_3O_8$](https://www.uxc.com/p/prices/UxCPrices.aspx)

<img src=img/uranium.world.jpg align="left">

What do you do if you don't have it? 

Check out Australia
---
## Uranium mining extracts ore from the ground, and then is refined by milling

The ore contains $UO_2, UO_3$, and other heavy metal oxides

Usually using solvents to leach it from the ground

Then it is chemically treated to obtain [‘yellowcake’](http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/11/c5fbed2f-575a-41bb-886e-f26700d43255-2060x1236-2.jpeg) $U_3O_8$

Lots of contaminated scrap is produced though (mill tailings)

Usually dumped as sludge in ponds (lots)

Radioisotopes (radon), heavy metals, chemicals, etc.

We have plenty of uranium resources  
But what if we decide it is too harmful to mine?
---
## $U_3O_8$ is converted to $UF_6$ prior to enrichment with $^{235}U$

Mined U contains $^{234}U$, $^{235}U$, $^{238}U$, .0054%, .72%

Because it is a gas at not so high temperature which is easier for enrichment

Anyone know how this is done?

Enriched to 3% to 5%

The byproduct is depleted uranium DU  
Used for armor and bullets

Any idea why?

---
## [Separative work unit](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/swu/) (SWU) tells of the amount of work to enrich uranium from natural abundance to reactor/weapon grade

Dumb acronyms are why people hate nuclear

### $x_F = 0.0072$   
### $x_P = 0.03 - 0.05$  
### $x_W = 0.0002 - 0.0003$ (operator determined)

Amount of feed for target product increases linearly with $x_P$ by mass conservation
---
<img src=img/mass.conservation.jpg align="left">

$~$
$~$
$~$

$F = P + W$

$F \cdot x_F = P \cdot x_P + W \cdot x_W$
---
## SWU measures thermodynamic work to separate isotopes

### $SWU \equiv [P \cdot V(x_P)+W \cdot V(x_W)]-F \cdot V(x_F)$   
SWU has units of kg because of course it does

Where the ['value function'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ENwqH9aCq5UnZ4NHNCdHZfN1U/view) is defined as:

### $V(x_i) \equiv (2x_i - 1) \cdot ln \frac{x_i}{1-x_i}$

The derivation is based on entropy changes

It's a bit much - change in entropy in binary mixture of gases
---
![SWU](img/swu.jpg)

## The fuel fabrication process (LWRs) makes ceramic $UO_2$ pellets

Why?

Is there anything better? 

Fuel rods contain a Zr-based alloy

[Also generates hydrogen gas](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/47/032/47032411.pdf)

### $Zr+2H_2O \rightarrow ZrO_2+2H_2$

That's kind of what happened at [Fukushima](https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110322/full/471417a.html)

## Macro reactor operation
---
## The first man made reactor was constructed at [University of Chicago](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/front-end-of-the-fuel-cycle-2/) in 1942

## A [natural reactor](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/nuclear-fuel-cycle-system/) actually happened about [2 billion years ago](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/neutronics/)

16 sites operated for about $10^5$ years at 100 kW thermal

French company found samples of 0.60% of $^{235}U$

How much is there normally?

Uranium rich mineral deposits were infiltrated by groundwater which served as moderator

## [EBR I](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/nuclear-fuel-cycle-system/) was the first reactor to [generate electricity](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/fuel-cycle-analysis/)

In 1951 - now a museum, open to the public for free

About 200 kW of electricity

Also was a breeder and first to confirm Fermi’s theory

‘Fast’ reactor, metal fuel and molten salt designs

Then the commercial reactors switched to ceramic and water

Why?

Now the so called Generation IV reactor designs use metals and salts

## [TREAT](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/front-end-of-the-fuel-cycle/) is an air cooled, graphite moderated thermal reactor

Operation from 1959 to 1994

Transient reactor tests to simulate all sorts of reactor accidents

George Imel

Restarted and working on experiments!

Because of Fukushima, TREAT will test 'accident tolerant fuels'

Everyone is excited

100 kW, transients up to 19 GW

## Nuclear reactors are used on submarines and aircraft carriers

Nautilus launched in 1954, 25 year life span

Nimitz-class aircraft carriers have 2 reactors, about 100 MW, 23 year life span

How about now?

## Reactors make a lot of hot water
---
## Reactors were first built in the 1950s

<img src=img/generation.jpg align="left">

Gen IV is essentially based on Gen I

Different material for fuels and coolant

Moderators not needed for some

Passive safety systems

Proliferation issues - so they say
---
## The PWR heats water but does not boil

<img src=img/pwr.system.jpg align="left">

Water is moderator, reflector, coolant
---
## The BWR does boil water in the reactor vessel

![BWR system](img/bwr.system.jpg)
---
#### The CANDU design uses heavy water (moderator) and natural uranium (also thermal)

![CANDU](img/CANDU.jpg)
---
## More on CANDU

Used in Canada and marketed to other nations

South Korea, China, India have some

PWR design (two loops)

The heavy water is less absorbing so natural U can be used

But also more collisions would be needed than in LWRs

The core would be bigger  
But can use used fuel from LWRs, and a Th cycle

So is there an advantage?  Technical?  Institutional?

## Reprocessing
---
### [Aqueous recycling](http://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/library/reprocessing/nrcseminarreprocessing_terry_todd.pdf) is the [commercially available process](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/chapter/countercurrent-solvent-extraction/) for the LWRs now

Major nations are France, Japan, Russia, India

'Recycle' is better for the brand  

About 1% 235U and 1% Pu in used fuel

The most common is PUREX

This uses an organic phosphate and nitric acid

Solvent extraction process where U and Pu are separated  
Then created into a MOX fuel

So for PUREX, what is a big risk?
---
class: center,middle

[![PUREX flowsheet](img/purex.jpg)](http://www.paducahvision.org/img/uranium/uranium4.jpg)
---
### U and Pu are chemically separated through organic solvent equilibrium extraction

U and Pu exist in a number of valence states

Because of different redox potentials, reduction or oxidation can be done to one without disturbing the other

Each exhibits different solubilities in organic solvent (TBP)

0- Chop up everything, remove FP gases, dissolve in aqueous solution  
1- Separate U/Pu from fission products by dissolving in solvent  
2- Reduce Pu to 3+ because it is highly insoluble in solvent (U 6+)  
3- Back extract Pu into aqueous solution  
4- Strip U from solvent into aqueous solution
---
### U and Pu are chemically separated through organic solvent equilibrium extraction

Aqueous solution is nitric acid  
Does generate a lot of liquid waste

Mass transfer to solvent phase = extraction  
Mass transfer to aqueous phase = stripping
---
### Mass transfer operates in a continuous, multistage, countercurrent mode

High separation factor
High processing rates

Streams flow countercurrently, so concentration is relatively constant

Solvent must be recycled because it's not cheap

First applied to extract Pu for weapons production in 1952 at Hanford site
---
## Metals in 4+ and 6+ are extracted

#### $(UO_2)^{2+}(aq) + 2(NO_3)^-(aq) + 2TPB(o) \leftrightarrow UO_2(NO_3)_2 \cdot 2TBP(o)$

#### $An^{4+}(aq) + 4NO_3^-(aq) + 2TBP(o) \leftrightarrow An_2(NO_3)_4 \cdot 2TBP(o)$

Pu (as 4+) co-extracted with U

Anything 3+ or lower is not

Waste is vitrified into a borosilicate glass waste form for disposal

Well characterized material with 50+ years of scientific study

Very stable
