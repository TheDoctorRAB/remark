## Look at the fuel cycle from systems engineering pov

Mining

Making the fuel (saw Areva plant in Richland)

What a reactor does and the different kinds

Recycling (what kinds and how)

Back-end management (storage and disposal)

The fuel cycle has a lot of technical but institutional issues too

How are they functionally dependent? 
---
## The fuel used in the commercial reactors is $UO_2$ or $ (Pu+U)O_2$

<img src=img/cycle.components.jpg align="left">

**Front end:** making the fuel and putting it in the reactor

**Back end:** what happens when you take it out of the reactor
---
## We have to find uranium first - [$U_3O_8$](https://www.uxc.com/p/prices/UxCPrices.aspx)

<img src=img/uranium.world.jpg align="left">

What do you do if you don't have it? 

Check out Australia
---
## Uranium mining extracts ore from the ground, and then is refined by milling

The ore contains $UO_2, UO_3$, and other heavy metal oxides

Usually using solvents to leach it from the ground

Then it is chemically treated to obtain [‘yellowcake’](http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2017/11/c5fbed2f-575a-41bb-886e-f26700d43255-2060x1236-2.jpeg) $U_3O_8$

Lots of contaminated scrap is produced though (mill tailings)

Usually dumped as sludge in ponds (lots)

Radioisotopes (radon), heavy metals, chemicals, etc.

We have plenty of uranium resources  
But what if we decide it is too harmful to mine?
---
## $U_3O_8$ is converted to $UF_6$ prior to enrichment with $^{235}U$

Mined U contains $^{234}U$, $^{235}U$, $^{238}U$, .0054%, .72%

Because it is a gas at not so high temperature which is easier for enrichment

Anyone know how this is done?

Enriched to 3% to 5%

The byproduct is depleted uranium DU  
Used for armor and bullets

Any idea why?

---
## [Separative work unit](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/swu/) (SWU) tells of the amount of work to enrich uranium from natural abundance to reactor/weapon grade

Dumb acronyms are why people hate nuclear

### $x_F = 0.0072$   
### $x_P = 0.03 - 0.05$  
### $x_W = 0.0002 - 0.0003$ (operator determined)

Amount of feed for target product increases linearly with $x_P$ by mass conservation
---
<img src=img/mass.conservation.jpg align="left">

$~$
$~$
$~$

$F = P + W$

$F \cdot x_F = P \cdot x_P + W \cdot x_W$
---
## SWU measures thermodynamic work to separate isotopes

### $SWU \equiv [P \cdot V(x_P)+W \cdot V(x_W)]-F \cdot V(x_F)$   
SWU has units of kg because of course it does

Where the ['value function'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ENwqH9aCq5UnZ4NHNCdHZfN1U/view) is defined as:

### $V(x_i) \equiv (2x_i - 1) \cdot ln \frac{x_i}{1-x_i}$

The derivation is based on entropy changes

It's a bit much - change in entropy in binary mixture of gases
---
![SWU](img/swu.jpg)

## The fuel fabrication process (LWRs) makes ceramic $UO_2$ pellets

Why?

Is there anything better? 

Fuel rods contain a Zr-based alloy

[Also generates hydrogen gas](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/47/032/47032411.pdf)

### $Zr+2H_2O \rightarrow ZrO_2+2H_2$

That's kind of what happened at [Fukushima](https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110322/full/471417a.html)

## A [natural reactor](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/nuclear-fuel-cycle-system/) actually happened about [2 billion years ago](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/neutronics/)

16 sites operated for about $10^5$ years at 100 kW thermal

French company found samples of 0.60% of $^{235}U$

How much is there normally?

Uranium rich mineral deposits were infiltrated by groundwater which served as moderator

## [EBR I](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/nuclear-fuel-cycle-system/) was the first reactor to [generate electricity](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/fuel-cycle-analysis/)

In 1951 - now a museum, open to the public for free

About 200 kW of electricity

Also was a breeder and first to confirm Fermi’s theory

‘Fast’ reactor, metal fuel and molten salt designs

Then the commercial reactors switched to ceramic and water

Why?

Now the so called Generation IV reactor designs use metals and salts

## Reactors make a lot of hot water
---
## Reactors were first built in the 1950s

<img src=img/generation.jpg align="left">

Gen IV is essentially based on Gen I

Different material for fuels and coolant

Moderators not needed for some

Passive safety systems

Proliferation issues - so they say
---
## The PWR heats water but does not boil

<img src=img/pwr.system.jpg align="left">

Water is moderator, reflector, coolant
---
## The BWR does boil water in the reactor vessel

![BWR system](img/bwr.system.jpg)
---
#### The CANDU design uses heavy water (moderator) and natural uranium (also thermal)

![CANDU](img/CANDU.jpg)
---
## More on CANDU

Used in Canada and marketed to other nations

South Korea, China, India have some

PWR design (two loops)

The heavy water is less absorbing so natural U can be used

But also more collisions would be needed than in LWRs

The core would be bigger  
But can use used fuel from LWRs, and a Th cycle

So is there an advantage?  Technical?  Institutional?

## Reprocessing
---
### [Aqueous recycling](http://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/library/reprocessing/nrcseminarreprocessing_terry_todd.pdf) is the [commercially available process](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/countercurrent-solvent-extraction/) for the LWRs now

Major nations are France, Japan, Russia, India

'Recycle' is better for the brand  

About 1% 235U and 1% Pu in used fuel

The most common is PUREX

This uses an organic phosphate and nitric acid

Solvent extraction process where U and Pu are separated  
Then created into a MOX fuel

So for PUREX, what is a big risk?
---
class: center,middle

[![PUREX flowsheet](img/purex.jpg)](http://www.paducahvision.org/img/uranium/uranium4.jpg)
---
### U and Pu are chemically separated through organic solvent equilibrium extraction

U and Pu exist in a number of valence states

Because of different redox potentials, reduction or oxidation can be done to one without disturbing the other

Each exhibits different solubilities in organic solvent (TBP)

0- Chop up everything, remove FP gases, dissolve in aqueous solution  
1- Separate U/Pu from fission products by dissolving in solvent  
2- Reduce Pu to 3+ because it is highly insoluble in solvent (U 6+)  
3- Back extract Pu into aqueous solution  
4- Strip U from solvent into aqueous solution
---
### U and Pu are chemically separated through organic solvent equilibrium extraction

Aqueous solution is nitric acid  
Does generate a lot of liquid waste

Mass transfer to solvent phase = extraction  
Mass transfer to aqueous phase = stripping
---
### Mass transfer operates in a continuous, multistage, countercurrent mode

High separation factor
High processing rates

Streams flow countercurrently, so concentration is relatively constant

Solvent must be recycled because it's not cheap

First applied to extract Pu for weapons production in 1952 at Hanford site
---
## Metals in 4+ and 6+ are extracted

#### $(UO_2)^{2+}(aq) + 2(NO_3)^-(aq) + 2TPB(o) \leftrightarrow UO_2(NO_3)_2 \cdot 2TBP(o)$

#### $An^{4+}(aq) + 4NO_3^-(aq) + 2TBP(o) \leftrightarrow An_2(NO_3)_4 \cdot 2TBP(o)$

Pu (as 4+) co-extracted with U

Anything 3+ or lower is not

Waste is vitrified into a borosilicate glass waste form for disposal

Well characterized material with 50+ years of scientific study

Very stable

![PUREX flow](img/purex.flow.jpg)
---
## Typical mass conservation is used to model [solvent extraction](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/countercurrent-solvent-extraction/)

This is from Benedict 

Distribution coefficient = organic/aqueous phase concentration at equilibrium

### $D \equiv \frac{y}{x}$

When an aqueous solution of an extractable component is brought into equilibrium with an immiscible solvent for the component and the two phases are then separated, the component will be found distributed between the two phases
---
## We then derive the material balance on the extractable component

### $Fz = Fx + Ey$

With $D$ for the system defined before
---
class: center,middle

![single stage extraction](img/single.stage.jpg)
---
## Derive the concentration that is extracted

### $D \equiv \frac{y}{x}$

### $Fz = Fx + Ey$

### $\therefore y = \frac{Dz}{1+\frac{ED}{F}}$

And the fraction extracted is 

### $\rho = \frac{Ey}{Fz} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{F}{ED}}$

For design then, you only need 3 parameters
---
## Derive the solvent feed needed for a given extraction

### $\frac{E}{F} = \frac{\rho}{D(1-\rho)}$

What is the functional dependence of $E(\rho)$?

Amount of used fuel isn't actually a variable 
---
## Reduce the amount of solvent needed by using multiple contact stages

With many stages, high extraction fraction can be obtained

Solvent is expensive, so recycling stages are also added to strip out extract

Multiple components can be extracted from organic phase if D is different enough  
So this would be needed to completely separated U, Pu

Physical conditions affecting D:  
Element extracted  
Redox potential of aqueous phase  
Solvent  
Concentrations  
[H+]aq

---
## Now apply same mass conservation to multistage extraction

Assume equilibrium between phases

Material balance on extractable component below stage n

![multistage mass balance](img/multistage.mass.balance.jpg)

### $y_{n-1} - y_0 = \frac{F}{E}(x_n-x_1)$

For any stage

### $y_n \equiv D_nx_n$
---
### [McCabe-Thiele diagram](http://ljs.academicdirect.org/A20/079_094.pdf) can be used for constructing graphical solution for for stage concentrations

Basically gives the number of stages for an extraction concentration $x_F$

By graphing $y_{n-1} - y_0 = \frac{F}{E}(x_n-x_1)$ on y versus x

Construct operating line to satisfy the above and pass through $x_1,y_0$ with slope $\frac{F}{E}$ relative to equilibrium line $y_n = D_nx_n$

Cannot really change equilibrium line because it is based on $D$

Reduce the concentration of the extractable component from $x_F$ to $x_1$ with $\frac{F}{E}$

Start at $x_1,y_0$ and move up

## Derive the extraction factor for multiple stages

### $\rho \equiv \frac{Ey_N}{Fx_F}$

Or

### $1 - \rho = \frac{x_1}{x_F}$

What does this tell us? 

And feed ratio can be defined in terms of $f(\rho)$ as 

### $\frac{E}{F} = \frac{\rho x_F}{y_N-y_0}$

What about here?
---
class: center,middle

## How many stages for complete extraction?

## What does that look like on McCabe-Thiele?
---
## Apply these concepts to model multistage extraction based on [Kremser equation](http://facstaff.cbu.edu/rprice/lectures/kremser.html)

From before  
$y_{n-1} - y_0 = \frac{F}{E}(x_n-x_1)$  
$y_n \equiv D_nx_n$

And the extraction factor is   
$\beta \equiv \frac{DE}{F}$

Then 

![extaction equation](img/extraction.equation.jpg)

### $y_N = \frac{\beta^N - 1}{\beta - 1}(Dx_1-y_0) +y_0$
---
## This can also be applied if there are two extractable components in the feed

Given

### $D_A,D_B,\beta_A,\beta_B$

Define decontamination factor. What does this mean?

### $f_{AB} \equiv \frac{\rho_A}{\rho_B}$

### $f_{AB} = \frac{\beta_A}{\beta_B}(\frac{\beta^N_A - 1}{\beta^N_B - 1})(\frac{\beta^{N+1}_B - 1}{\beta^{N+1}_A - 1})$ for $y_0 = 0$

## Back-end management overview
---
## What do you do with the fuel when you take it out of the reactor?

Either the used fuel is reprocessed or disposed

But there is always going to be some high-level waste

High-level waste = highly radioactive, some long-lived, toxic

So far in USA, used fuel is stored in the pool and in dry casks

What’s the problem with keeping the spent fuel just lying around?

Who has 'active' repositories? How is safety determined?

Watch 'Into Eternity' if you can
---
## So what is supposed to be done with the waste?

NAS in 1957 recommended deep disposal in salt

Why salt?

Lyons KS was investigated 1957-72, but scrapped due to public opposition

Why would the public possibly be opposed?

WIPP authorized in 1980 and received waste first in 1999  
Zero accidents recorded, not counting the moron who lost his badge when we were there

WIPP = TRU waste (from weapons program)

[WIPP accident](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/back-end-of-the-fuel-cycle/)
---
## Nuclear waste policy act (1982) is the basis for HLW management in USA

Established disposal in geologic formation  
Sites studied: Hanford, Yucca Mountain, Texas

Amendment in 1987: only Yucca Mountain (70000 MTHM)  
Supposed to start in 1998

A license application was submitted to NRC in 2008  
Obama Administration withdrew any further funding

August 2013 U.S. Court of Appeals DC  NRC resumed work on  safety review 
 
January 2015 NRC Safety Evaluation Report  
Working Environmental Impact Statement early [2016](https://www.nrc.gov/waste/hlw-disposal/key-documents.html)
---
class: center,middle

## But what happens if the license is granted?
---
class: center, middle

## How should nuclear facilities be cited?
---
## [Blue Ribbon Commission](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/back-end-of-the-fuel-cycle/) was formed to review back-end policy

Really, because there wasn't any policy

1- A new, consent-based approach to siting future nuclear waste management facilities.

2- A new organization dedicated solely to implementing the waste management program and empowered with the authority and resources to succeed.

3- Access to the funds nuclear utility ratepayers are providing for the purpose of nuclear waste management.

4- Prompt efforts to develop one or more geologic disposal facilities.

5- Prompt efforts to develop one or more consolidated storage facilities.
---
6- Prompt efforts to prepare for the eventual large-scale transport of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste to consolidated storage and disposal facilities when such facilities become available.

7- Support for continued U.S. innovation in nuclear energy technology and for workforce development.

8- Active U.S. leadership in international efforts to address safety, waste management, non-proliferation, and
security concerns.

Not particularly revolutionary (Peterson), but what other nations are doing around the world

The point of the BRC was to establish consensus
---
## The Energy Policy Act in (1992) set regulatory framework for repositories

40CFR197: EPA radioactivity releases

10CFR63: Construction, operation, closure

NAS review in 1995  
Extended time frame of peak risk to 1 million years (of adverse health effects)

So what do you do to demonstrate compliance out to 1 million years?
