# NE527: Nuclear material storage, transport, disposal 
## Project 3
### Low level waste manangement and dispoal 
#### [450]

<p>
1. [100] Develop a relatively high-level case study of the Ward Valley site. Address site selection, characteristics, major findings of the performance assessment, type of waste accepted, etc. What went wrong? Who are the stakeholders?

<p>
2. [100] Try to find performance assessment of a low level waste facility. Report on the site characteristics, waste acceptance criteria, and mathematical modeling. How is regulatory compliance assessed?

<p>
3. [50] What are the currently operating commercial LLW facilities? What type of waste is accepted at each? What is the operating licese? How are inspections conducted for regulatory compliance?

<p>
4. [100] How is a low level waste facility sited? Site a location for a new low level waste facility using this procedure.

<p>
5. [50] How is depleted uranium treated and stored? Where are these facilities?

<p>
6. [50] What classifies as GTCC waste. What is this material? Where is is stored? What are the regulations, performance assessment, etc.?
