## NUCLEAR MATERIAL STORAGE, TRANSPORT, DISPOSAL
### Nonproliferation regime 

#### 1
---
### Outcomes for the lecture

Define proliferation risk in terms of nuclear materials attractiveness

Criticize global nonproliferation policy

Demonstrate relevance to storage, transport, disposal

Calculate materials attractiveness
---
### Nuclear materials exist in a wide variety of physical, chemical form

Fuel pellets

Powders

Solutions

Metals

Gas

## What is proliferation?
---
### There are two areas in the conventional nuclear fuel cycle where bombs can be made illegally

Material control

Safeguards

Export control

Physical protection

Transport protection

## Why would a State want a nuclear weapon?
---
### The [nonproliferation treaty](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/) (NPT) was established to in 1970

Extended indefinitely in 1995

**Nonproliferation**  
NWS not encourage other States to develop weapons  
NNWS accept IAEA safeguards (but further agreements)

**Peaceful use**  
Development of civilian nuclear energy systems  
Demonstrate not for weapons programs via IAEA inspections

**Disarmament**  
Negotiate in good faith to halt production and disarm

Iran claims that 'peaceful use' clause gives sovereign right to enrich uranium

What is the case with DPRK?
---
### Is the NPT successful?

1945 - 1 NWS

1968 - 5 NWS

Post 1968 - 9 NWS

2020 - ?
---
### IAEA deals with PR with a State and State deals with PP domestically

**Proliferation resistance** is that characteristic of a nuclear energy system that impedes the diversion or undeclared production of nuclear material, or misuse of technology, by the host **State** in order to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.

**Physical protection** is that characteristic of a nuclear energy system that impedes the theft of materials suitable for nuclear explosives or radiation dispersal devices, and the sabotage of facilities and transportation, by **sub-national entities** and other **non-host State** adversaries.
---
### There are two kinds of PR measures

**Intrinsic design features**  
Physical or material properties and engineering design of the system

*Strategic value of SNM*  
isotopic composition  
chemical barriers  
high heat due to additional radioisotopes

*Design features to impede diversion pathways*  
multiple barriers provide defense-in-depth

**Extrinsic controls**  
DIV for the IAEA + inspections  
Other IAEA agreements (CSA and AP)  
State MA&C

Work in the PR field draws on many engineering principles
---
### States are required to verify activities

Account for and control nuclear material

Collect, maintain information on nuclear and related activities

Provide infromation to IAEA
---
### IAEA inspectors verify State compliance

Implemented in 153 States with Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements based on [INFCIRC/153 Corr](https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/infcircs/structure-and-content-agreements-between-agency-and-states-required-connection-treaty-non-proliferation-nuclear-weapons)

Voluntary offer safeguards agreements from NWS 

Item-specific safeguards agreements based on [INFCIRC/66](INFCIRC/66)
---
### The [Model additional protocol](https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/infcircs/model-protocol-additional-agreements-between-states-and-international-atomic-energy-agency-application-safeguards) was approved in 1997

IAEA has more rights of access to information and locations

Voluntary acceptance by host State

Over 100 nations accepted (including Iran)
---
### The State must provide thorough information

Is all relevant infromation with the State nuclear program consistent?

Is the picture of State activities present and planned complete?

Is there sufficient information on which to draw sound conclusions?

Inspectors conduct their own investigations with their own equipment
---
### AP allows IAEA much broader access

Information and access to all aspects of State nuclear fuel cycle

Information and *short notice* access to all buildings on a site

Information and access to other locations where nuclear material is present

Information and access to fuel cycle related R&D

Information on manufacture and export of specified equipment and non nuclear materials

Environmental sampling beyond declared locations

Information on future plans to develop the fuel cycles
---
### How can someone acquire special nuclear material?

Concealed diversion from declared facilities (IAEA safeguards)

Concealed production of material in clandestine facilities

Break-out (this is what DPRK did)

Subnational theft and sabotage can include data and other technical information
---
### Materials accounting and control is essential to PR

Integrated measures to provide information, control, and assurance of the presence of nuclear material

Establish and track material inventory

Control access to and detect loss or diversion of material

Ensure the integrity of systems and measures
---
### Accounting and control are strongly linked

Accounting - tracking material  received, processed, produced, shipped, transferred, relocated, used, or stored

Controls - apply administrative and technical measures to ensure material is not removed from its *assigned location*, modified, or used without proper approval and accounting

Without control you cannot account

Without accounting you cannot control
---
### There are several techniques used for safeguards

Radiation signatures - detect gammas and/or neutrons by detection

Non/destructive assay - sight, weight, counting items, composition

Containment and surveillance - seals, cameras

Assure continuity of knowledge - maintain information state between inspections

Design information verification - construction of new facilities as declared by State

Open source resources - ?
---
### The primary safeguards goal is the timely detection of the diversion of a significant quantity of SNM

Limit false positives to resolve anomaly (type I)

High probability to detect misuse/diversion (type II)

Nuclear materials accounting and containment/surveillance

Verifying compliance with safeguards agreements

CSA and Additional Protocol

See [IAEA glossary](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/iaea_safeguards_glossary.pdf) for the tables
---
### Type I/II errors are based on some heavy statistical theory

Based on hypothesis testing for materials accounting statistics

Not strictly a nuclear engineering issue

So, with everything perfect the materials balance is zero; i.e., M = 0

But it's never that because of all the different kinds of uncertainy

Basically, you assume E(M) = 0 and do a lot of statistics to get Type I 

Similarly, you assume E(M) = S and do all that to get Type II

### Statistical theory can be applied to determine SEID

$\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha) + \Phi^{-1}(1-\beta) = \frac{SQ}{\sigma}$

$\alpha = 0.05$

$1-\beta = 0.95$

$SQ=8 \; kg$

$\sigma \leq 2.4 \; kg$

Uncertainty of what?

### Safeguards-by-design was thought up to avoid costly retrofitting

Rokkasho

'International safeguards are fully integrated into the design process of a new nuclear facility from the initial planning through design, construction, operation, and decommissioning'

Avoid costly and time consuming redesign work or retrofits of new nuclear fuel cycle facilities

Make the implementation of international safeguards more effective and efficient at facilities
