## Why would a State want a nuclear weapon?
---
### The [nonproliferation treaty](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/) (NPT) was established to in 1970

Extended indefinitely in 1995

**Nonproliferation**  
NWS not encourage other States to develop weapons  
NNWS accept IAEA safeguards (but further agreements)

**Peaceful use**  
Development of civilian nuclear energy systems  
Demonstrate not for weapons programs via IAEA inspections

**Disarmament**  
Negotiate in good faith to halt production and disarm

Iran claims that 'peaceful use' clause gives sovereign right to enrich uranium

What is the case with DPRK?
---
### Is the NPT successful?

1945 - 1 NWS

1968 - 5 NWS

Post 1968 - 9 NWS

2020 - ?
---
class: center, middle

## Proliferation resistance and physical protection
---
### IAEA deals with PR with a State and State deals with PP domestically

**Proliferation resistance** is that characteristic of a nuclear energy system that impedes the diversion or undeclared production of nuclear material, or misuse of technology, by the host **State** in order to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.

We do this by applying safeguards

**Physical protection** is that characteristic of a nuclear energy system that impedes the theft of materials suitable for nuclear explosives or radiation dispersal devices, and the sabotage of facilities and transportation, by **sub-national entities** and other **non-host State** adversaries.

We do this by detection, delay, response
---
### There are two kinds of PR measures

**Intrinsic design features**  
Physical or material properties and engineering design of the system

*Strategic value of SNM*  
isotopic composition  
chemical barriers  
high heat due to additional radioisotopes

*Design features to impede diversion pathways*  
multiple barriers provide defense-in-depth

**Extrinsic controls**  
DIV for the IAEA + inspections  
Other IAEA agreements (CSA and AP)  
State MA&C

Work in the PR field draws on many engineering principles
---
### The purpose of PP is to prevent an adversary from successful completion of a malevolent action against a facility

What is the target to protect?

What is the threat?

What level of protection is adequate?

The typical term is 'guns and guards'

Very different now in a cyber context
---
### States are required to verify activities

Account for and control nuclear material

Collect, maintain information on nuclear and related activities

Provide infromation to IAEA
---
### IAEA inspectors verify State compliance

Implemented in 153 States with Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements based on [INFCIRC/153 Corr](https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/infcircs/structure-and-content-agreements-between-agency-and-states-required-connection-treaty-non-proliferation-nuclear-weapons)

Voluntary offer safeguards agreements from NWS 

Item-specific safeguards agreements based on [INFCIRC/66](INFCIRC/66)
---
### The [Model additional protocol](https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/infcircs/model-protocol-additional-agreements-between-states-and-international-atomic-energy-agency-application-safeguards) was approved in 1997

IAEA has more rights of access to information and locations

Voluntary acceptance by host State

Over 100 nations accepted (including Iran)
---
### The State must provide thorough information

Is all relevant infromation with the State nuclear program consistent?

Is the picture of State activities present and planned complete?

Is there sufficient information on which to draw sound conclusions?

Inspectors conduct their own investigations with their own equipment
---
### AP allows IAEA much broader access

Information and access to all aspects of State nuclear fuel cycle

Information and *short notice* access to all buildings on a site

Information and access to other locations where nuclear material is present

Information and access to fuel cycle related R&D

Information on manufacture and export of specified equipment and non nuclear materials

Environmental sampling beyond declared locations

Information on future plans to develop the fuel cycles
---
### How can a State acquire special nuclear material?

Concealed diversion from declared facilities (IAEA safeguards)

Concealed production of material in clandestine facilities

Break-out (this is what DPRK did)

Subnational theft and sabotage can include data and other technical information
---
class: center, middle

## Nuclear materials accounting
---
### Materials accounting and control is essential to PR

Integrated measures to provide information, control, and assurance of the presence of nuclear material

Establish and track material inventory

Control access to and detect loss or diversion of material

Ensure the integrity of systems and measures
---
### Accounting and control are strongly linked

Accounting - tracking material  received, processed, produced, shipped, transferred, relocated, used, or stored

Controls - apply administrative and technical measures to ensure material is not removed from its *assigned location*, modified, or used without proper approval and accounting

Without control you cannot account

Without accounting you cannot control
---
### There are several techniques used for safeguards

Radiation signatures - detect gammas and/or neutrons by detection

Non/destructive assay - sight, weight, counting items, composition

Containment and surveillance - seals, cameras

Assure continuity of knowledge - maintain information state between inspections

Design information verification - construction of new facilities as declared by State

Open source resources - ?
---
### The primary safeguards goal is the timely detection of the diversion of a significant quantity of SNM

Limit false positives to resolve anomaly (type I)

High probability to detect misuse/diversion (type II)

Nuclear materials accounting and containment/surveillance

Verifying compliance with safeguards agreements

CSA and Additional Protocol

See [IAEA glossary](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/iaea_safeguards_glossary.pdf) for the tables
---
### Type I/II errors are based on some heavy statistical theory

Based on hypothesis testing for materials accounting statistics

Not strictly a nuclear engineering issue

So, with everything perfect the materials balance is zero; i.e., M = 0

But it's never that because of all the different kinds of uncertainy

Basically, you assume E(M) = 0 and do a lot of statistics to get Type I 

Similarly, you assume E(M) = S and do all that to get Type II

See [Avenhaus](http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/689/1/XB-77-102.pdf)

And [me and Jieun](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029549318308549)

class: center,middle

![MBAs](img/mba.jpg)
---
### Statistical theory can be applied to determine SEID

$\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha) + \Phi^{-1}(1-\beta) = \frac{SQ}{\sigma}$

$\alpha = 0.05$

$1-\beta = 0.95$

$SQ=8 \; kg$

$\sigma \leq 2.4 \; kg$

Uncertainty of what?

See [Avenhaus](http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/689/1/XB-77-102.pdf) page 15

## Sidebar

### Safeguards-by-design
---
### [Safeguards-by-design](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-nuclear/chapter/safeguards/) was thought up to avoid costly retrofitting

Rokkasho

'International safeguards are fully integrated into the design process of a new nuclear facility from the initial planning through design, construction, operation, and decommissioning'

Avoid costly and time consuming redesign work or retrofits of new nuclear fuel cycle facilities

Make the implementation of international safeguards more effective and efficient at facilities
---
class: center, middle

## Nuclear materials attractiveness
---
### [Material attractiveness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.13182/NT10-203) is 'how ready' a weapon can be made 

Measure of proliferation risk

'Utility of nuclear material to make a nuclear explosive device'

Why?

There are (were) fuel cycles with reprocessing that pose proliferation risk

After fission products are removed, the heat load is significantly lower

SNM - $^{239}Pu, \; ^{233}U, \; ^{235}U$

Also - $^{237}Np, \; Am$ and others
---
### Goals for a proliferant State is different than subnational groups

Presumably, the State has the technical capability to fabricate a weapon

For subnational groups, the act itself, and just having the material

They can still use it in an explosive device even if it's not a *nuclear* weapon
---
### What makes a material attractive?

Bare critical mass

Internal heat generation

Dose rate

Intrinsic neutron generation rate

How should these factors be optimized?
---
### What materials are attractive in fuel cycles?

Reactor grade Pu - the Pu produced by regular power reactor operation

Not like a breeder reactor to produce Pu

Advanced reprocessing approaches

Available TRUs

Advanced fuel cycles
---
### What are quantifiable factors for attractiveness?

LEU threshold - $20\% \; ^{235}U$

$^{238}Pu$ threshold - $80\%$

Self-protection - $500 \; rad/h$ at 1 m

For a proliferant State - intrinsic neutron rate of $^{240}Pu > 20\%$
---
### DOE graded safeguards provide the greatest relative amount of control and accountability

Determination of category involves grouping materials by type, attractiveness level, and quantity

Material quantities are element weights for plutonium and isotope weights for uranium-235 and uranium-233

A single material type may have multiple attractiveness levels

Separated $^{237}Np, \; ^{241}Am, \; ^{243}Am$ protected, controlled, and accounted for as if they were SNM

### For a state intending to build a stockpile of nuclear weapons based on fissionable materials in metal form

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;\LARGE&space;FOM_1=1-log(\frac{M}{800}&plus;\frac{Mh}{4500}&plus;\frac{M}{50}[\frac{D}{500}]^{\frac{1}{log&space;\;2}})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\LARGE&space;FOM_1=1-log(\frac{M}{800}&plus;\frac{Mh}{4500}&plus;\frac{M}{50}[\frac{D}{500}]^{\frac{1}{log&space;\;2}})" title="\LARGE FOM_1=1-log(\frac{M}{800}+\frac{Mh}{4500}+\frac{M}{50}[\frac{D}{500}]^{\frac{1}{log \;2}})" /></a>

M = bare critical mass of the metal (kg)

h = heat content (W/kg)

D = dose rate 1 m from the surface (rad/h) of 0.2M

Metal acquired after reprocessing

I interpret this as a technically capable NNWS like ROK
---
### For an unadvanced proliferant nation, preinitiation is an issue

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;\large&space;FOM_2=1-log(\frac{M}{800}&plus;\frac{Mh}{4500}&plus;\frac{MS}{6.8&space;\times&space;10^6}&plus;\frac{M}{50}[\frac{D}{500}]^{\frac{1}{log&space;\;2}})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\large&space;FOM_2=1-log(\frac{M}{800}&plus;\frac{Mh}{4500}&plus;\frac{MS}{6.8&space;\times&space;10^6}&plus;\frac{M}{50}[\frac{D}{500}]^{\frac{1}{log&space;\;2}})" title="\large FOM_2=1-log(\frac{M}{800}+\frac{Mh}{4500}+\frac{MS}{6.8 \times 10^6}+\frac{M}{50}[\frac{D}{500}]^{\frac{1}{log \;2}})" /></a>

S = neutron emission rate (n/s/kg)

Again, for after reprocessing
---
### To make material unattractive, FOM less than 1

See [Table I](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.13182/NT10-203#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTMxODIvTlQxMC0yMDM/bmVlZEFjY2Vzcz10cnVlQEBAMA==) for FOM and graded safeguards

Let's look at results

Dr. Bathke concludes that no fuel cycle can be proliferation resistant

## Nuclear security

'Prevention and detection of, and response to, theft sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive substances or their associated facilities'

(IAEA)

(NTI lecure)
---
### Nuclear security deals mainly with subnational actors

Weapons‐usable nuclear material exists at hundreds of sites in 25 countries

Terrorists have stated desire to obtain nuclear weapons

Not all sites are well secured

Not necessarily about terrorist actually building a weapon

Attack anywhere is an attack everywhere
---
### Nuclear security is typically sovereign responsibility of each State

Regulatory systems are not exactly the same

No global system for tracking, protecting, managing nuclear material

Multilateral agreements

Only civilian materials

Not really with any of the NWS
---
### What would a global system look like?

Cover all weapons usable material

Employ international standards and best practices

Internal assurance and accountability mechanisms on the State level

Provide international assurance of secure materials and faciltiies

Reduce risk though minimizing quantity and location of weapons usable materials
---
### There are limitations

Different views on magnitude of the threat

Should only be State responsibility

Sharing security arrangements is sensitive
---
### The UN has recognized the importance of nuclear security with UNSCR 1540 (2004)

'Requires' States to establish laws to prohibit non-state actors from acquiring, possessing, using WMDs

Implement appropriate controls over related materials, including security and accounting, to prevent WMD proliferation

1540 Committee is responsible for managing implementation

Countries must report progress to the committee

Like any treaty, not enforceable

No consequences for non compliance

No way to really monitor implementation
---
### The Nuclear Suppliers Group is for nuclear exports and dual use items

Aim to ensure that peaceful nuclear trade does not contribute to proliferation of nuclear weapons

Only authorize items where safeguards will be in place

Should have physical security measures in place

Non binding

Differences in national laws could lead to inconsistencies
---
### The World Institute for Nuclear Security provides a forum for best practices

WINS produces produces best practices practices guides and self assessment tools

Developing training for nuclear security professionals

Funding isn't so great though
---
### What are the takeaways?

International nuclear security is relatively patchwork

There is genuine effort to figure out what works best

Lack of funds

No centralized international body like IAEA

What is the real risk?
