## [Waste Isolation Pilot Plant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/WIPP/@32.3715169,-103.7958586,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8830e5cae55ca943:0xa15022872190c36f!8m2!3d32.3715169!4d-103.7936699?hl=en)
---
### WIPP is a repository for transuranic waste

Not classified as HLW

Contains more than 100 nCi/g alpha emitting TRUs

Half life greater than 20 years

Varies internationally

Can be incinerated, compacted, immobilized (cement, bitumen)
---
### Can be categorized by external dose rate

Contact handled - less than 200 mrem/h  
Plutonium, americium, curium

Remote handled - greater than 200 mrem/h  
Strontium, cesium, barium, cobalt, europium

What are differences?

(May also contain hazardous substances regulated under [RCRA](https://www.epa.gov/rcra))
---
### TRU waste originates from a variety of sources

Fuel reprocessing

Waste immobilization

Fuel fabrication from Pu recycle

Weapons production

Decommissioning nuclear facilities
---
### [First licensed nuclear waste respository ever!](https://www.wipp.energy.gov/fctshts/Chronology.pdf)

Authorized in 1979 by Congress

26 miles east of Carlsbad

2150' underground - Salado formation

16 square miles Chihuahuan desert - 10240 acres

No flowing water - 200 million year stable salt formation

Began receiving TRU waste in 1999-14 - 91,100 cubic meters of waste

Resumed in 2017

Nominal operating life of 25 years

[12259 shipments](https://www.wipp.energy.gov/general/GenerateWippStatusReport.pdf) from 13 sites
---
class: center,middle

![USA salt formations](img/usa.salt.png)
---
### WIPP Land Withdrawal Act of 1992

Created regulatory process to open WIPP

They actually built it before there were regulations on disposal

EPA as licensing authority

DOE had to obtain hazardous waste permit from the State of New Mexico

Required NRC licensing of all shipping packages to WIPP

Established 15 years of economic assistance for New Mexico (roads)

Provided funding and assistance related to transportation for other States and Tribes along shipping corridors

Set aside 16 square miles around the completed facility for WIPP development

Exempted TRU mixed waste disposal from Land Disposal Restrictions
---
### Who runs WIPP?

Carlsbad area office created by DOE to manage TRU waste nationwide

Westinghouse is managing and operating partner

Sandia is lead technical contractor
---
### WIPP takes contact and remote handled waste 

97% volume is contact handled

55 gallon drums

Emits alphas

Remote handled is in shielded casks

Emits gammas
---
### Ground control is important to worker safety

Ground is always moving

Rocks falls are a high hazard

Daily inspections

Mill floors

Bolt walls, chain meshing
---
### Operational facility still requires ventilation

Underground ventilation - 60,000 cfm

Removes VOCs off gassing from waste containers

Confines radiological contaminants

So only so many people can be down there at once

Air flow routes can be changed based on activities
---
### Other funding was provided for supplemental projects at WIPP

Road repairs

Triennial independent reviews of environmental regulatory compliance and operations 

Enhanced emergency training

Create an emergency operations center in Carlsbad

## [Human instrusion into WIPP](https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/1.19135!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/529149a.pdf)
---
### [Humans will intrude inadvertently or intentionally](https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/1.19135!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/529149a.pdf)

Inadvertent - escape of radionuclides to biosphere  
Threat - human health, environment

Intentional - acquire fissile material  
Threat - nonprliferation, arms race
---
### What would happen for inadvertent intrusion? 

Mining for resources

Salt  
Potash  
Oil, gas

How? - drilling 

What else?

How likely will this happen over the next 10,000 years?

What happened 10,000 years ago?

5 intrusion events per 100 years over the 10,000 year regulatory period
---
class: center,middle

![WIPP drill](img/wipp.drill.jpg)
---
### The intrusion risk may be poorly estimated

1996 - 46.8 boreholes drilled per $km^2$  
2014 - 67.3 boreholes drilled per $km^2$

Only 40% increase 
---
### Intentional intrusion could be from a non-state (subnational) actor

This would assume that the material in WIPP is retrievable 

Who would try? 

Important - safeguards terminated on disposal
---
### Would the USA secretly mine Pu buried in WIPP?

This would be like an undeclared diversion

But how would they do that?
---
### Intentional intrusion would still involve borehole drilling

Pump water in to dissolve salt

Pump up the brine to clear it out

Works up to 2000 m

Pump water and oxidzing materials back down and suck up Pu material

Salt seals it back up

Is this really necessary

### [41CFR provides relevant regulations](http://dels.nap.edu/resources/static-assets/nrsb/miscellaneous/WIPP9/DUNAGANDAYZEITLEROverviewofPAforSPD-SeanDunagan.pdf)

[40CFR191](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/part-191) - standards for TRU disposal

[40CFR194](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/part-194) - WIPP specific rules for (re)certification

WIPP must be designed to provide resonable expectation that cumulative releases of radionuclides to the accessible environment for 10,000 years after closure from all significant processes and events shall be less than specified release limits

Recertification every 5 years

### Manufactured Pu during the Cold War

586 square miles along Columbia river

Began operation in 1944

Nine reactors

Underground HLW tanks - 56 million gallons
---
### Largest single environmental cleanup in the world

Did not really worry about waste storage during Cold War

2.4 billion cleanup budget (FY2014)

Tri Party agreement (1989) stipulates milestones for cleanup

Tank waste removal, waste treatment, environmental restoration
---
### There have been several accomplishments met since 1989

Disposal of over 17 million tons of contaminated soil and debris along Columbia River corridor

Removal of used fuel basins adjacent to the river

5000 cubic meters TRU waste shipped to WIPP

All weapons grade Pu shipped to Savannah River

Pump and treat systems, chemical barriers installed along Columbia River corridor

Cocooned 6 of the 9 reactors 

Removal of HLW from undergraound storage tanks
---
### Remaining cleanup over 300 billion

Funds are not guaranteed

Primary concern is potential threat to Columbia River

Half of the HLW tanks have leaked

Plans to build a vitrification plant to treat HLW onsite for 2036

Low activity waste to begin treatment 2023

Transfer of 1936 capsules of Cs and Sr to dry storage

Removal of high concentrated waste from below the hot cell in the 300 area
---
class: center,middle

## [Savannah River](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Savannah+River+Ecology+Laboratory/@33.3439285,-81.7400945,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x88f9b080755d6d7d:0xd0cfe16291aac1e6!8m2!3d33.343812!4d-81.7349768?hl=en)
---
### SRS started in 1950s to produce radionuclides for weapons

310 square miles in Aiken county

After Cold War, the priority was cleanup

Like Hanford

SRS still processes tritium, uranium, plutonium

More than 500 contaminated sites and 14 groundwater contamination plumes

Groundwater can discharge to surface waters and Savannah River

Cleanup budget 1.4 billion
---
### Cleanup agreements have been made with State, EPA, DOE

Treatment of 35 million gallons of hazardous and HLW 

Closing aging atorage tanks - 1/3 of total

Processed 7 per cent of salt waste volume (2017)

90 percent of HLW is salt waste

Approved procedures for cleanup of 81 percent of contaminated sites

Adopted area closure approach instead of individual buildings, soil, etc.

## [Management and disposal of DOE used fuel](https://www.nwtrb.gov/docs/default-source/meetings/2019/november/leslie.pdf?sfvrsn=4)

## [Report](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/barber2/docs/doe-dec17.pdf)
---
### Approximately 250 types of used fuel owned by DOE

Guesses?
---
### Approximately 250 types of used fuel owned by DOE

Fort St. Vrain

Fast flux test facility

TMI

ATR

High flux isotope reactor

TRIGA

Shippingport
---
### Diversity of fuel types and storage conditions affect management

Fuel compound - U metal, dioxide, U-Al

Cladding and condition - stainless steel, Zr, Al

U enrichment - covers the whole range

Wet and dry storage

Storage materials
---
### DOE EM and DOE NE are the agencies responsible for fuel management

DOE EM manages storage at the sites

Design and packaging containers for transport and disposal

DOE NE transports fuel from sites to repository
---
### DOE NE establishes acceptance criteria

Fuel packaded in DOE standardized container

Waste form limits to pyrophoricity, explosivity, combustibility, chemical reactivity, organic content

Canister contents limits with respect to gas generation, thermal effects, particulate concentrations, corrosion

Criticality safety by using neutron absorbing materials in the canister
---
### DOE Al fuel will be in about 29% of all DOE standardized canisters

Like ATR

Can have high surface area

Cladding corrosion

High water content 
---
### Board made six recommendations

Develop and implement SNF degradation management

Measure and monitor conditions of SNF in new storage systems

Conduct R&D to confirm reactions with SNF and water aren't adverse

License a standard canister before INL facility design

DOE-NE adopt OCRWM acceptance criteria to account for pyroprocessed SNF

Account for DOE SNF degradation when researching repository sites

And there's related tasks
