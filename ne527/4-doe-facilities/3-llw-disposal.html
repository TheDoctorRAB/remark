---
class: center,middle

## Low level waste does not emit much heat
---
### LLRW policy (1980) governs LLW disposal

'Not HLW, SNF, byproduct material'

Class A must be contained up to 100 years  
Lowest concentration of radionuclides  
Clothes, instruments, tools

Class B from 200 - 300 years  
Contains either just short lived or long lived radionuclides  
If mixed, less than 10% of Class C limit for long lived

Class C up to 500 years  
Highest concentration limit suitable for shallow land burial  
NPP materials, activation products

GTCC not acceptable for near surface disposal   
Responsibility of federal government
---
### Must not pose undue risk to people or environment

Dose limit

Prevent human intrusion

See [Table 4](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20061213_RL32163_f036cbfc63ece1cd85c0261fb0f4c70ba675117b.pdf) p22
---
### Each state has responsibility for LLW generated within borders

States have since entered into compacts

States can dispose LLW to another state in the compact

Congress granted 10

But there are only [four active disposal sites](https://www.nrc.gov/waste/llw-disposal/licensing/locations.html)

[MIMS](https://mims.doe.gov/)

[Agreement States](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/state-tribal/agreement-states.html) may assume some NRC regulatory authority

class: center,middle

## What are favorable physical, geochemical factors for a facility?
---
### What are favorable factors for a facility?

Low rainfall - less surface infiltration  
Deep water table  
Hydraulic conductivity - too high, rapid transport; too low, ponding  
Slow groundwater flow  
High ion exchange  
Homogeneous geology  
Minimal erosion  
No useable resources  
No surface water bodies  
Low faulting or volcanoes  
---
### Six DOE facilities accept disposal of government LLW

INL

LANL

ORNL

Savannah River

Hanford

Nevada National Security Site

Clive and Andrews (commercial)
---
### There are four commercial LLW sites

Barnwell

Clive

Richland

## Performance assessment
---
### Performance objectives are in [10CFR61 C](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part061/)

61.41 - Dose rate limits (25 mrem whole body) radioactivity release

61.42 - Protection against inadvertent instrusion

61.43 - Protection during operations

61.44 Stability of site after disclosure

[NUREG-1573](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0532/ML053250352.pdf) for guidance
---
class: center,middle

## What is a performance assessment?
---
### Systematic analysis if what could happen at a site

Risk-informed  
What can go wrong?  
How likely?  
What consequences?

Collect data  
Develop models/codes  
Validate  
Analyze results

Assessments are risk informed and performance based
---
### Design is based on defense-in-depth

Ensure barriers, controls will prevent, contain, mitigate exposure

Risk associated with barrier, controls failures must be acceptably low

Manage risks based on performance based regulations and oversight
---
class: center,middle

![LLW example](img/llw.jpg)
---
class: center,middle

## What are some intruder scenarios?
---
### What are some intruder scenarios?

Construction  
Inhaling radioactive dust  
Direct exposure from the waste itself

Agriculture  
Building on top of the facility
Soil to root transfer   
Plant-human  
Plant-animal-human
Direct exposure (irrigation)

Pathways established in [10CFR61 C](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part061/)
---
### [NUREG-1573](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0532/ML053250352.pdf) provides a flowchart for assessment

Data evaluation  
Conceptual models, scenarios  
Parameter distributions  
Mathematical models, codes  
Consequence modeling  
Sensitivity, uncertainty analysis  
Site performance evaluation  
Iterate

Engineered barrier - container breach, leaching, source term  
Vadose zone transport  
Saturated zone flow and transport  
Surface water transport  
Exposure scenarios   
Pathway analysis  
Dose to human

Quality assurance
---
### NRC recommends licensees use plain language in their safety case

*Strategy for Achieving Safe Disposal of Radioactive Waste:* The safety strategy should include an overall management strategy for the various activities required in the planning, operation, and closure of a land disposal facility, including siting and characterization, facility and disposal site design, development of the technical analyses, operations, waste acceptance, environmental monitoring, and institutional control

*Description of the Disposal Site and Facility:* The description of the disposal site and facility should describe the relevant information and knowledge about the disposal system and should provide the basis for the technical analyses
---
*Description of the Technical Analyses Demonstrating Performance Objectives:* The description of the technical analyses should summarize the performance assessment, inadvertent intruder assessment, site stability analyses, performance period analyses, and analyses of the protection of individuals during operations

*Strategy for Institutional Control of the Disposal Site:* The institutional control strategy should summarize the institutional information required by 10 CFR 61.14

*Description of Financial Qualifications of the Licensee:* The description should summarize the financial information required by 10 CFR 61.15

*Description of Other Information:* Depending upon the nature of the wastes to be disposed of and the design and proposed operation of the land disposal facility, the description may need to summarize other information required by 10 CFR 61.16
---
*Safety Arguments:* The safety arguments should draw together the key findings from the technical analyses to highlight the main evidence, analyses, and arguments that quantify and support the claim that the land disposal facility will ensure protection of public health and safety

The safety case evolves over time

## Feature, event, process analysis
---
### FEP assists with scenario development, PA, safety case

**Feature**  
Object, structure, or condition that has a potential to affect repository system performance

**Event**  
Natural or human-caused phenomenon that has a potential to affect repository system performance and that occurs during an interval that is short compared to the period of performance

**Process**  
Natural or human-caused phenomenon that has a potential to affect repository system performance and that occurs during all or a significant part of the period of performance

FEP typically is a process or event acting upon or within a feature
---
### FEP analysis is part of a broader performance assessment methodology

![Process model](img/process.model.jpg)
---
### FEP supports scenario development

Performed and refined over multiple iterations

FEP list captures all phenomena that are potentially relevant to the long-term performance of a disposal system

Formal FEP analysis provides objective evidence that all potentially relevant FEPs have been addressed

[Features, Events and Processes (FEPs) for Geologic Disposal of Radioactive Waste](https://www.oecd-nea.org/rwm/reports/2000/nea2549-features-events-processes-for-disposal.pdf)

[Guidance for Conducting Technical Analyses for 10 CFR Part 61](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1505/ML15056A516.pdf)

See Appendix C
---
Apparently, Jones, R.H. 2011, Features, Events, and Processes for the Disposal of Low Level Radioactive Waste - FY 2011 Status Report,
Revision 0, Prepared for U.S. Department of Energy Used Fuel Disposition Campaign, FCRD-USED-2011-000297, doesn't exist even though it is cited everywhere
---
### Typically, LLW facility has more FEPs than HLW

Due to shallow burial

More surface events - erosion, soil transport

Human intrusion probability is higher

There are also more engineered barrier systems - concrete vaults, drains
---
class: center,middle

![FEP matrix](img/fep.matrix.jpg)
---
### Each FEP defined by associated processes

Transport of radionuclides in liquid phase in backfill

Advection  
Dispersion    
Diffusion  
Matrix diffusion  
Intra-aqueous complexation  
Isotopic dilution  
Dilution by mixing with formation waters  
Solubility of radionuclides and other species
