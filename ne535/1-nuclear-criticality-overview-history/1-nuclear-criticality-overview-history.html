# Learning objectives

Explaining seminal criticality accidents

Demonstrating causes and consequences
---
||Definition||Source||
|:-----------|:------|
||protection against the consequences of an inadvertent nuclear chain reaction, preferably by prevention of the reaction||ANSI/ANS-8.1||
||protection against the consequences of a nuclear excursion||LA-3366||
||prevention or termination of inadvertent nuclear criticality, mitigation of consequences, and protection against injury or damage due to accidental criticality||DOE Order 5480.5||
||art of avoiding an accidental nuclear excursion||TID-7016 Revision 2||
||art and science of not building a nuclear reactor without shielding, coolant, and control||Francis Alcorn, former Nuclear Criticality Safety Manager, BWX Technologies||
---
### ANSI 8.1 defines a criticality accident as the release of energy as a result of accidentally producing a self-sustaining or divergent neutron chain reaction

Another common definition for a nuclear criticality accident is an unintentional, uncontrolled nuclear fission chain reaction

It releases large amounts of undesirable energy in the form of heat and radiation

A nuclear criticality accident may consist of a single burst after which the system is exhausted and shuts itself down

The nuclear criticality accident might be repetitive, producing a series of bursts before it exhausts itself and shuts down
---
### A monitoring system shall be maintained in locations where licensed special nuclear material is handled, used or stored

The monitoring system shall be capable of detecting a criticality that produces an absorbed dose in soft tissue of 20 rads of combined neutron and gamma radiation at an unshielded distance of 2 meters from the reacting material within one minute

Coverage of all areas shall be provided by two detectors

[10 CFR 70.24](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part070/part070-0024.html)
---
### Integrated safety process is s intended to increase confidence in the margin of safety from all hazards, including criticality

Performanced based, risk informed goals

Systematic analysis to identify facility and external hazards and their potential for initiating accident sequences, the potential accident sequences, their likelihood and consequences, and the items relied on for safety

Limited to consideration of the effects of all relevant hazards on radiological safety, prevention of nuclear criticality accidents, or chemical hazards directly associated with NRC licensed radioactive material

Management measures include configuration management, maintenance, training and qualifications, procedures, audits and assessments, incident investigations, records management, and other quality assurance elements

Process safety information means information pertaining to the hazards of the materials used or produced in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process

# Let's quickly review nuclear physics

Fission 

Chain reaction

Critical

Subcritical

Supercritical

Fissile

Fissionable

Fertile
---
## Criticality safety draws on many nuclear engineering disciplines

Radiation transport   
Reactor kinetics  
Nuclear physics  
Human factors
---
class: center, middle

## What is the singular objective of criticality safety?
---
## Criticality safety orginated as a reactive process

Much like the main criticism we've had of risk assessment

Accident analysis

Designed experiments (not accidents)

Modeling  
KCODE in MCNP  
KENO in SCALE
---
# Let's take a look at some milestones

1885 - Roentgen discovers x-rays  
1905 - Einstein posits special relativity  
1932 - Chadwick discovers neutrons  
1938 - Hahn, Strassmann, Meitner, Frisch discover fission  
1939 - FDR establishes [Advisory Committee on Uranium](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/s-1-committee) for research  
1941 - Japanese bomb [Pearl Harbor](https://www.nps.gov/valr/index.htm) and USA formally enters WWII  
1942 - Manhattan Project kicks off - 1250 tons of U purchased from Belgian Congo  
---
# A little more on the Manhattan Project

52000 acres in TN become Oak Ridge   
Invents/applies gaseous diffusion  
Hanford established for pultonium production

Dec 1942 - Fermi creates first chain reaction with CP-1  
Jul 1945 - Trinity test at Alamogordo  

Just three years!  
Think of that when people complain that we can't get rid of plastic straws

Aug 1945 - Hiroshima and Nagasaki

Nov 1945 - Los Alamos established  
Dec 1952 - Livermore established
---
## Criticality safety is a particular subset of risk assessment

Prevent chain reactions in operations facilities (on purpose)  

Prevent inadvertent chain reactions in nonreactorr environments (not on purpose)

Protection means -  
1. Prevent chain reaction (frequency)  
2. Mitigate chain reaction (consequence)
---
## How criticality safety (as a field/profession) evolved

There wasn't any criticality information

How close to critical could a configuration get?

What affects $k_{EFF}$?

[Early criticality experiments](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/11/514/11514135.pdf)

Correlate with theory

[Develop standard practices](https://www.nnss.gov/pages/facilities/NCERC.html) - Note applications
---
# Early nuclear was nuts

No one knew anything

Learning as they went

Early practices became later standards 

Experimental data provided lessons learned
---
# Let's look at the big picture

Management needs to establish policy and take responsibility for control of accidents

Operating officials, health/safety personnel, supervisors, oversight all have a stake in criticality safety

Formalized procedures and [standards](https://www.techstreet.com/subgroups/55483?action=show&controller=subgroups&gateway_code=ans&id=55483&sort_order=doc_no&sort_direction=asc&sort_direction=asc&sort_order=doc_no&per_page=50) 
Quality control for materials and equipment  
Occupational safety

Training -  
Prevention  
Emergency response  
Reporting procedures
---
# General approaches to criticality safety

Optimize risk v benefits

Safety based (risk informed) standards

Simple protection systems and strategies

Balance engineering controls, physical limits, operations, administration

Avoid common cause failures - no single incident can lead to criticality
---
# The demon core was one of the earliest accidents

Basically the third atomic bomb in case Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren't enough

About 14 lbs of plutonium and gallium

Accidents occurred during testing

Tickling the dragon's tail
---
class: center, middle

![Demon core](img/demon.core.jpg)
---
# Harry Daghlian caused the first accident

Decided to tickle the dragon alone - 21 August 1945

Stacking tungsten carbide bricks around the core to increase reflection

Dropped a brick on the core making it go super critical

800 rads

Died 25 days later
---
# The demon core wasn't done

Louis Slotin was demonstrating a similar experiment using a beryllium sphere

Used a screwdriver to maintain a gap between the core and beryllium

So of course the screwdriver slipped and the core went supercritical

21 May 1946

Slotin knocked the beryllium off to shut it down

1000 rads

Died 9 days later

No more hands on experiments after that
