# Learning objectives

Understanding the difference between audits and assessments

Performing an audit or assessment
---
**Assessments** are the reviewing, inspecting, testing, checking, conducting surveillances, auditing, or otherwise determining and documenting whether items, processes, or services meet specified requirements

Assessments are performed by or for management

**Audits** are planned and documented independent assessments to determine by investigation, examination, or evaluation of objective evidence the adequacy of and compliance with established procedures, instructions, drawings, and other applicable documents, and the effectiveness of implementation

An audit shall not be confused with surveillance or inspection activities performed for the sole purpose of process control or product acceptance

Driven by governing regulations - specific to facility
---
### Audits are examining quality assurance

ISO9000 defines an audit - systematic, independent, and documented process for obtaining audit evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which audit criteria are fulfilled

Systematic - planned activity, can’t be at random/ without planning or without intimation to the auditee    
There are certain steps/activities that are required to be done for an audit like Opening Meeting, Audit Execution, Audit Finding Briefing, Audit Reporting and Audit Finding Closure

Independent - has to be done by someone external to the system being audited

[NQA-1](https://www.nslanalytical.com/nqa1-nuclear-program) was reated by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers current version is 2015, however, the NRC endorses the 2008 version with the 2009 addendum
---
[10 CFR 830 Subpart A, Quality assurance requirements](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2011-title10-vol4/CFR-2011-title10-vol4-part830/context)

[10 CFR Part 50 Appendix B, Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part050/part050-appb.html)
---
### Audits assess the effectiveness of safety and emergency management systems and practices

Povide clear, concise, rigorous, and independent evaluation reports of performance in protecting workers, the public, and the environment from the hazards associated with DOE activities

[DOE Order 227.lA, Independent Oversight Program](https://www.directives.doe.gov/directives-documents/200-series/0227.1-BOrder-A)

[DOE Office of Nuclear Safety and Environmental Assessments](https://www.energy.gov/ea/downloads/organizational-chart/office-environment-safety-and-health-assessments/office-nuclear)

[DOE – EA – CRAD 31-30, Criticality Safety Program and Criticality Safety Controls Implementation Criteria and Review Approach Document](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/06/f33/31-30%20EA%20CRAD%20CSP%20and%20Criticality%20Safety%20Controls%20Implementation.pdf)
---
### An effective audit will assess implementation of criticality controls 

Ensure fissile material activities will remain subcritical under both normal and credible abnormal conditions

All engineered features (active and passive) and administrative controls may be considered during this review as long as they are being relied upon to prevent a criticality accident
---
### Audits are systematic

Time and place is predetermined

Identification of specific programs/facilities/organizations

Audit team based on scope of the audit

Usually involve a request for specific program documents prior to the audit

Written method for evaluation and reporting of non-conformances

Procedure for the facility to respond and document corrective actions to non-conformances
---
### Audits verify a fully compliant criticality safety program has been implemented

Criticality safety controls have supporting criticality safety analysis basis and are sufficiently reliable to ensure a changes in process conditions necessary for a criticality accident is at least "unlikely"

Criticality safety controls are implemented using documented and approved processes, and implementation is effective
---
### All records are reviewed

Criticality Safety Program Document  
Criticality Safety Program Implementing Documents  
Documented Safety Analysis  
Technical Safety Requirements  
Nuclear Criticality Safety Evaluations  
Fissile Material Operations Procedures  
Criticality Safety Postings

Training materials on how and why to comply with the selected  criticality safety controls,  including how to determine values of items being controlled and how to operate and calibrate systems that give alarms or other useful indications when limits are exceeded, and a sample of the respective training records, including measures to ensure that ce1tified fissionable materials handlers perform work with fissionable materials  and associated  systems, equipment, and materials
---
Records relating to infractions or violations of selected criticality safety controls, any trends, and resultant analyses and corrective actions designed to prevent or minimize repeat infractions. Additionally, review records relating to lesser deviations of these controls that may indicate insufficient diligence

Contractor assessment activity schedules and assessment results for independent, management, and other self-assessments and external reviews/inspections
---
### Interview everyone

Criticality Safety Management  
Criticality Safety Staff  
Criticality Safety Officer  

Facility Management   
Facility Safety  
Operations Personnel

Maintenance Supervisors  
Maintenance Personnel  
Design Engineers

Configuration Management
---
### Conduct walkthoughs

Verify installed instrumentation and control and support equipment required to ensure ongoing implementation of selected criticality safety controls and proper emergency responses will function under credible accident/event conditions

Fissile material operations

Fissile material staging operations

Surveillance of criticality safety related safety systems and controls

Fissile material operating procedures implementing the criticality safety controls

Activities in support organizations

Normal maintenance activities on associated with fissile material fissile material
---
### Conduct thorough independent review of the criticality safety documentation for technical adequacy

Verify that a sufficient level of quality assurance is embedded in the program

The auditors job is not to verify through independent calculations

The independent confirmation calculations are done at the program level

The auditor is responsible for ensuring the NCS program is adequate, thus by proxy, ensuring that all of the confirmation and verification checks are adequate
---
### Making the team

Adequate historical and educational experience  
Demonstrated technical competence  
Function specific training  
Qualification process includes “apprentice program”  
Must stay current through active participation and education/training  

Technical specialists selected for audit assignments shall receive indoctrination commensurate with the scope, complexity, or special nature of the work being audited. In addition, they shall be trained to the requirements of the audit process associated with their duties

Auditors shall be technically qualified in their assigned roles. In addition, they shall have appropriate training or orientation to develop their competence for performing audits
---
### Assessments are less formal

Assessments are generally less formal

Only focus on a specific item or function within a system

Time frames can vary and are less rigorous

Can be used by management to determine the readiness or status of a system or function

Assessments do not need to be independent

Similar activities to an audit
---
### Resulting in a formal declaration that the system/function/organization is functioning as required

Items to be evaluated may require further inspection

If action is not taken, observations may lead to findings later on

Generally findings severe enough to stop work, or postpone startup or resumption of work require corrective actions prior to acceptance

Findings should always be tied to a requirement

There needs to be an action that results in the correction
---
### Several requirements to meet to verify compliance

Site Contractor has prepared and submitted a NCS program description document that has been approved by DOE   
Current and consistent with the commitments in the applicable DSA

Facility has prepared implementing mechanisms for the NCS program that meet the requirements of DOE O 420.1C and the commitments in each DSA and TSR

Procedures and mechanisms ensure that nuclear facility operations covered by the NCS program are conducted in accordance with implementing mechanisms requirements

Issues identified during previous reviews have been appropriately resolved, corrective actions have been completed and are adequate, or a clear path to completion is indicated 

Adequate roles and responsibilities have been clearly defined
---
Verification of training, including the operators understanding of NCS principles, controls, and procedures

Independence of auditor

Ensure validation of closure activities for reviews of the NCS program

Records of internal audits and assessments
---
### Verify a criticality accident is at least "unlikely""

Criticality safety controls are crafted using sound engineering/scientific principles (e.g., defense in depth, conservative design margins, human factors engineering) and appropriate standards 

Technical, functional, and performance requirements for NCS controls are specified in criticality safety documents

These documents identify and describe the safety functions and are effectively translated into procedures and workspace postings

Criticality safety controls are robust and meet the Double Contingency Principle or DOE has granted a specific exemption which incorporates the foregoing criteria

The effects of changes to criticality safety requirements or conditions to which they apply are reviewed and understood before the start of operations
---
The CSEs identify and describe the selected criticality safety control safety functions

The CSEs for selected criticality safety controls appropriately reflect assumptions of facility configuration and human performance of safety functions, operational parameters, and key programmatic elements
---
### Verify controls are implemented using documented and approved processes

Management organizational structures and systems provide assurance that criticality safety controls are implemented and are being maintained such that they will fully and reliably perform their safety functions over the life of the facility 

The adequacy of criticality safety controls is confirmed by individuals or groups other than those who performed the work

Confirmation, as well as activities ensuring that the technical basis for the controls is adequate is completed before the start of operations

The adequacy determination considers that no single credible event or failure can result in a criticality
---
NCS controls are implemented are adequately communicated to workers via training, statements in procedures, workplace postings and other operator aids as appropriate

The need for materials labeling and other identifiers used to prevent criticality is understood and are adequate, i.e.,  workers may readily verify limit compliance

Control violations or procedure non-conformances are investigated, corrected, and documented. Cases where controls are discovered to be confusing or inadequately understood are resolved whether or not an actual non-adherence occurs 

Actions used to ensure that limits are not exceeded are adequate, and involved personnel are aware of the potential consequences due to erroneous data or actions
---
Planned response to criticality accidents is adequate and evacuation drills and other activities verify workers understand and can execute their responsibilities during a response to a criticality alarm
---
### The auditor responsibility is to ensure compliance with a requirement

Is there a documented plan/program?

Is it approved?

Is it periodically reviewed?

Do the employees know and understand the program, and are they following it?

Are there postings at the worksite?

Are the posting being followed?

Are changes to a system documented, reviewed, and approved for NCS concern? 

Is there independence?
---
### Look for objective evidence that an action has been completed

Signed forms, training documents, actual postings, safeguards or inventory logbooks

Meeting briefings

Documentation of management involvement, usually during document reviews

If the regulation specifies a requirement, what is the evidence that the requirement was followed
---
### Use caution

**Auditor**   
Don’t be afraid to ask questions and get clear answers  
Follow the process to ensure consistency  
Little things can mean a deeper problem exists under the surface

**Auditee**  
Only answer questions asked  
Go to the records and get the answer  
Give the audit the attention it deserves
