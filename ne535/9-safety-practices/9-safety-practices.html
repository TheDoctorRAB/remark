# Learning objectives

Applying [risk assessment](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-riskassessment/) principles to criticality safety

Determining appropriate levels of safety
---
## Safety is an acceptable balance of risk and benefit

Responsibility for safety implementation must be at a level closest to the operation

Safety regulations should be based on professionally generated standards

Simple, convenient safety provisions are more effective than complex or awkward arrangements
---
## Protection of life is more important than the protection of property

General nuclear‐safety guidance is superior to stereotyped rules intended for broad application

Risk is to be recognized, and its control is to be somewhat more stringent than that which is considered good practice in non‐nuclear industry
---
## Double contingency principle is like [common cause failure](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/uidaho-riskassessment/chapter/common-cause-failures/)

No single mishap – regardless of its probability of occurrence – can lead to a criticality

Another way of stating – two unlikely, independent, and concurrent changes in process conditions must occur before criticality is possible

Common cause isn't always independent events
---
## ANS 8.1 defines double contingency

Process designs should, in general, incorporate sufficient factors of safety to require at least two unlikely, independent, and concurrent changes in process conditions before a nuclear criticality accident is possible

This is liked risk informed design (to me)
---
### There are several key factors affecting process design

Chemical process  
Physical configuration  
Material composition

Two such changes are necessary before a nuclear criticality accident is possible

Changes must be - 
Unlikely - Change that is not expected to occur during the lifetime of the plant (design basis)  
Independent - Change that is not a result or condition of the first change  
Concurrent - Second change that occurs while the first change is still active

Not quite common cause then - but need to be aware
---
## Storage of fissile metal fines or dust

||Characteristic||Normal  ||Upset     ||
|:---------------|:-------||:----------|
||Mass           ||Limited||Over batch||
||Moderation     ||Dry    ||Flooded   ||

Loss of mass control

Loss of moderator control

How might this happen? 
---
### Ensure that at least 2 process changes are required before a nuclear criticality accident is possible

Determine failure probabilities 

This isn't easy for anything

Look for common cause, cascading, concurrent failures

Always the sticking point for risk assessment
---
### Administrative practices are developed by senior management

Establish appropriate level of training 

Determine modifications to processes

Including effects of credible abnormal conditions

Written procedures  
Controlled movement of material  
Continual Feedback – prompt reporting  
Emergency planning  
Quantitative evaluation  
Develop metrics to compare against  
Routine updates and re-evaluation  
Frequent independent operational reviews

---
## There are process parameters governing criticality risk

Geometry Control

Poisons

Mass and Volume Limits

Moderation Control

Concentration Control

Storage and Transport

Control Specifications
---
### Many initiating events lead to criticality accidents

Critical liquids  
Transfer to geometrically unsafe vessel  
Unintended transfer  
Ignorance of concentration  
Valve problems  
Poor communication  
Lack of system knowledge  
Dangerous routine practices  
Errors of commission  
Errors by supervisors and managers  
Abnormal situations

Mitigating measures are alarms, evacuation procedures, and emergency preparedness  
---
## Engineering controls are also needed

Geometrically favorable containers and equipment  
Solid or soluble poisons in large-volume equipment and storage vessels  
Plant-protective-system or other automated control and shutdown features

Disconnect transfer lines when they are not in use; eliminate dependence on valves in general or, if necessary, use double valving and surveillance

Require written operating procedures and compliance with them  
Perform comprehensive accident analysis for entire process  
Perform criticality safety reviews of plant operations  
Provide criticality safety training and sensitization to affected personnel  
Employ multiple lines of defense against inadvertent material transfer, e.g., via both equipment design and procedures
---
Provide criticality limits and controls in an  effective format and evaluate them periodically  
Use sound fissile-material accountability practices  
Implement supportive health physics procedures and controls  

Support operator accountability and authority for criticality safety (including use of “stop work” when appropriate)

Implement a comprehensive criticality safety auditing program  
Implement modification control and configuration control based on system documentation, walk-downs, and complete functional verification  

Investigate incidents and perform root cause, common-mode-failure, and related analyses; report and trend the results; and implement appropriate corrective actions

Robust sampling and analysis programs
---
### What happens when we introduce controls that are excessively conservative?

Unnecessarily complex controls

When complexity goes up so does the risk

How do you know?
