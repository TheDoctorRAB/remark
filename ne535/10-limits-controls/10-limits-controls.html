# Learning objectives

Calculating appropriate limts to maintain criticality safety 

Developing controls to maintain criticality safety
---
### Nuclear criticality safety is achieved by controlling one or more factors of the system within subcritical limits

Administratively through procedures   
By requiring that mass not exceed a posted limit
 
Physical restraints  
Confining a solution to a cylindrical vessel with diameter no greater than the subcritical limit

Instrumentation   
Measuring to determine a concentration limit

Chemical means  
Prevention of conditions that allow precipitation
---
### Nuclear criticality control methods are generally selected with three main features

Reliability - Probability of success when called upon

Range of initiating events encompassed

Operational Support - Requirements for testing, analysis, maintenance, and operator actions

System designs are favored if they have high reliability, a broad range of coverage, and minimal needs for operational support
---
### A limit is a numerical value of a parameter that must be controlled within a defined allowable range

Critical limits, sometimes called failure limits, represent quantities or dimensions needed before a self-sustaining chain reaction is possible

Depending on these other conditions the operation could be critical

Limits are -  
1000 g U  
1 L container   
H:U = 0.088

Limits don't necessarily have numerical values 

Provide drain holes in plastic bags
---
### Subcritical limits and process limits

**Subcritical limits are - **
Just maintain subcriticality   
No contingencies considered  
No margin of safety  
About 1% margin of subcriticality (beyond the uncertainties)

**Process limits are -**  
Must account for contingencies  
Must define a safety margin in terms of margin of safety or margin of subcriticality  
Many parameters may need to be limited  
Usually permits an increase in the ANS Standards subcritical  value because multiple parameters are being controlled 
---
### Focusing on process limits 

What is available to be limited?

What value should it be limited to?

How to determine the value of the limit?

What safety margin should be included?

How to proceed from identifying limits to identifying controls?   
---
### A control is the apparatus, instructions, process, actions by which the limit is maintained

Within its allowable range to ensure a system is subcritical

Geometrically favorable process vessel  
Work Control Procedure that specifies a limit or verification action  
Implementation of a training program   
Implementation of a criticality safety program
---
### Detailed analyses are performed to determine criticality controls

Controls must be designed to accommodate the worst credible change in condition

Type and number of controls vary with the system considered

Most controls are very systems specific
---
### Engineering controls are a physical design that reliably serves as a criticality safety control

Geometrically favorable equipment

Piping

Process vessels

Storage arrays

Permanently fixed neutron absorbers

Engineering controls must be carefully considered
---
### Divide up parameters for control

**Physical**  
Mass  
Density  
Enrichment  
Geometry  
Volume  
Reflection  
Interaction  
Moderation  
Poisons

**Nuclear**  
Neutron generation   
Neutron leakage  
Neutron absorption 
---
### Most parameters are not independent variables

Changes in - 

Mass changes volume   
Density changes composition and geometry   
Internal moderation changes composition, density, volume  

A change in any parameter will probably cause changes in at least one other parameter

A single parameter may impact more than one nuclear characteristic

Internal moderation will change absorption and generation
---
### Same thing for nuclear characteristics

Changes in - 

Neutron production rate changes absorption and leakage 

Neutron leakage rate changes production and absorption

Neutron absorption rate changes production and leakage
---
### What controls can be instituted?

**Mass**  
Established limits for fissionable material  
Favorable volumes

**Volume**  
Fixed Geometry  
Established Limits   
Favorable geometry

**Enrichment**  
Equipment must be designed to the highest possible enrichment  
Separation of areas for different enrichments or treat all enrichment as maximum

**Subcritical geometry**
---
**Interaction**  
Specially designed equipment that maintains desired spacing

**Moderation**  
Limiting or excluding moderating materials  
Controlling concentration

**Reflection**  
Maintaining spacing limits to control proximity of reflectors to fissionable material  
Using physical barriers

**Density and concentration**  
Established and posted limits  
Procedures for sampling  
Instrumentation that measures concentration and prevents buildup
---
**Poisons**  
Chemical analysis  
Concentration control  
Procedures   
Scheduled monitoring for presence and effectiveness
---
![Controls chart](img/controls.jpg)
---
The criticality safety analyst (you) must understand the interdependency of changes in a parameter upon the other parameters, and the effect these changes will have upon the nuclear characteristics of the system
---
### Conduct parametric studies on $k_{EFF}$

How it changes as a parameter changes

How the other parameters are effected by the changes

Sensitivity of $k_{EFF}$ to the change

Selection of the right parameters for the analysis under consideration

Fix as many of the parameters as possible  
Other parameters may not be independent
---
### A 4 L beaker is used to dissolve uranium oxide in acid

Which of the control parameters can be fixed?

Which are variable?
---
### What safety margin should be included?

Reference to facility guides and handbooks

[Y-12 handbook](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4671484)

[Minimum critical masses at the Portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/26/033/26033356.pdf)

Use of the hand calculations

Computational tools

$k_{EFF} + 2\sigma \leq 0.90$ for normal conditions

$k_{EFF} + 2\sigma \leq 0.95$ for accident conditions

Data comparisons found in ANS standards
---
### Nuclear criticality safety is achieved by exercising control

Mass and distribution of fissile material

And all other materials associated with the fissile material

Parametric studies can identify what parameters to control, limits

But not how to control them
---
### Engineered controls are passive or active

Passive safety is also part of safety goals for reactors

Subcriticality is maintained without human or mechanical intervention

Active controls contain actuated systems the sense the process variable state and provides a response

Administrative controls require operator performance
---
### Engineering controls require oversight

Initial design

Correctly install

Pre operational verification

Ongoing (operational) effectiveness

Detecting any changes
---
### Active controls can be engaged by a sensor

Thermostat turns heater off  
Liquid level sensor starts pump  
Load cell closes supply line  
Pressure switch starts pump  
Computer controlled

Do these facilities use PLCs?
---
### Active controls of course need maintenance

Sensor - tolerance, drift, calibration

Actuator - motive force, time response

Detecting malfunctions or failures

Calibration
---
### Administrative controls are policies and procedures established by management to ensure that nuclear criticality safety controls are implemented effectively to maintain safe operating conditions

Established limits on the amount of fissionable material

Posted mass limits

Zone markings

Operating procedures

Training programs

Operations review

Material identification labels
---
### Operators will affect material parameters as part of administrative controls

Set mass limits

Set spacing limits

Set compositon limits

Count product pieces (materials accounting)

Undergo periodic training
---
class: center, middle

![Summary of controls](img/control.summary.jpg)
---
### Operator performance falls under human reliability studies

Human factors

Same as reactors in principle

Requires operator thought and action each time control function is needed

Difficult to determine double contingency state

Requires quick judgement sometimes and quick action

Ideal controls preferences move from minimum human intervention to total human intervention

Likely always going to need human intervention
---
### Controls must be functionally achievable 

Mass - Scales, records, logs

Composition (H/U) - Lab analyses

Temperature, pressure, environmentals - Dials, indicators

Fixed poisons - Visual, concentration control
