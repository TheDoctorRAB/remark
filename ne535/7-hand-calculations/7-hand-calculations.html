# Learning objectives

Understanding why hand calculations are needed 

---
### Before high speed computers, hand calculations were widely used

As a starting point for complex calculations

As a sanity check

To aid in understanding the relationships

*The few criticality accidents that have occurred in industrial operations have resulted from failure to anticipate conditions that might arise; none has resulted from a faulty calculation*
---
### Hand calculations provide insight into the physics behind neutron interactions

Faster and less expensive than computer calculations

With technology today, computers are relatively cheap, but labor hours are not

Good for boundary (worst case) conditions
---
### Though computational tools do require verification

ANS-8.1 - If the method involves a computer program, checks shall be performed to confirm that the mathematical operations are performed as intended

And validation 

Bias is systematic disagreement between calculated and experimental data

Bias shall be established by correlating the results of critical and exponential experiments with results obtained for these same systems by the calculational method being validated

Uncertainty in the bias shall contain allowances for uncertainties in the experimental conditions, for lack of accuracy and precision in the calculational method and for extension of the area (or areas) of applicability

But - everything is benchmarked by MCNP or SCALE
---
### Validation involves comparing calculation vs experiment for many benchmarks similar to the application of interest

Evaluation of method and cross section data

Assure yourself that methods and data can calculate the relevant experiments

Establish range of applicability

Establish bias

Uncertainty may be caused by uncertainties in analytical data

Or unknown parameters in system configurations

Validation indicates reliability of calculation as compared to known real conditions

*Conditions predicted to be subcritical would be expected to be subcritical*
---
ANSI/ANS-8.24 Foreword: “…the industry need to optimize operations and reduce unnecessary conservatism has increased. Thus, the scrutiny and importance placed on validation has increased in recent years.”
---
### Direct use of experimental data is preferred (ANSI/ANS-8.1-2014 4.2.7)

Where applicable data are available, subcritical limits shall be established on bases derived from experiments, with adequate allowance for uncertainties in the data

In the absence of directly applicable experimental measurements, the limits may be derived from calculations made by a method shown by comparison with experimental data to be valid in accordance with Sec. 4.3
---
## (ANSI/ANS-8.1-2014 4.3)

Validation shall be performed by comparison to experiments and AoA should be established from this comparison

Use of subcritical limit data provided in ANSI/ANS standards or accepted reference publications does not require further validation
---
### Verification is about the process

Indication of reliability that the mathematical operations are being performed as expected

Discuss [finite element method](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QB_6KhX6MGmjgTA7REBUFsCLwYpZ48Ble-zDhVuIW7I/edit?usp=sharing) verification
---
### The upper subcritical limit bounds the problem 

$k_{EFF}$ less than 1 is not sufficient to ensure subcriticality

Bias = calculated - experiment  for defined experiments

Bias uncertainty - 95%,99% confidence level

Code and data uncertainties

Uncertainty if benchmarks are not similar enough to application

$USL \equiv k_{EFF} + 2 \sigma$

USL = 1 + bias - bias uncertainty - benchmark

Set positive bias to 0

Can look up USL for the right experiments
---
### Bias uncertainty is a measure of precision of calculation and accuracy of experiment

Uncertainty in experiment

Lack of precision in calculational method

Extension to conditions out range of experiments

Calculated as some multiple (usually 3) of the standard deviation of the calculated values
---
### The area of applicability is the range covered by experiments in variable space

Variable space is the range of independent parameters where the model will produce acceptable results

Determine values for important parameters

Fissile material  
Enrichment (% range)  
Absorbers  
Moderation (H:X range)  
Moderating material  
Reflection material

Find benchmarks containing these nuclides to bound the conditions

Then do the problem to see if it is in bounds
---
### Sensitivity analysis quantifies how variation of material properties or nuclear data affects $k_{EFF}$

Change material densities or temperatures

Change dimensions

Used to justify simplifications and to quantify the impact of manufacturing tolerances and uncertainties

Used to support margin adopted for validation weaknesses

Perturbation theory methods
---
### Minimum subcritical margin is an extra safety margin applied to USL

Does a thorough validation exist?

Have independent experimenters been used?

How do conditions compare to AOA?

Is the system/process simple or complex?

Does fissile material maintain its shape?

Are the physics/chemistry well understood?

How sensitive is reactivity to changes?
---
### Methods stem from basic nuclear theory

One group diffusion theory is suitable for large, homogeneous systems with isotopes that have low neutron absorption

Diffusion theory is not a good method to use for small systems, near boundaries, or in or near strong neutron absorbing materials

Buckling conversion is suitable for simple geometries such as spherical, slab, or cylindrical systems

Can convert the neutron leakage characteristics for a critical simple geometry to another simple geometry that has equivalent leakage characteristics, as long as critical data exist for a particular system
---
Core density conversions can be applied to homogeneous, critical systems if the volume or density of the system changes uniformly

Applicable to bare systems or those with a close-fitting reflector, as long as the reflector density remains constant
---
### [Buckling](https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/neutron-diffusion-theory/geometrical-material-buckling/) uses critical data for a fissile system with simple geometries to determine the critical dimensions for other geometries

See table in Lamarsh

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;\LARGE&space;D&space;\nabla^2&space;\phi&space;-&space;\Sigma_A&space;\phi&space;&plus;&space;k_{\infty}&space;\Sigma_A&space;\phi&space;=&space;0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\LARGE&space;D&space;\nabla^2&space;\phi&space;-&space;\Sigma_A&space;\phi&space;&plus;&space;k_{\infty}&space;\Sigma_A&space;\phi&space;=&space;0" title="\LARGE D \nabla^2 \phi - \Sigma_A \phi + k_{\infty} \Sigma_A \phi = 0" /></a>

$\nabla^2 \phi + B^2 \phi = 0$

When a time-independent neutron flux can be sustained in the reactor with no sources other than fission

Diffusion theory treats leakage as being proportional to the geometric buckling of the system

Geometries with the same geometric buckling have the same leakage

Allows comparison of systems with the same materials
---
## Convert a cylinder to an equivalent sphere

h = 25 cm, d = 15 cm

$B^2 = (\frac{\pi}{h})^2+(\frac{2.405}{r})^2 = 0.44666$

$B^2 = (\frac{\pi}{r})^2 = 0.44666$

$r = 4.7 cm$

I neglected extrapolation distance

Applicable to simple geometries
---
### Core density conversion is used for uniform density changes

$\frac{r}{r_0}=\frac{\rho_0}{\rho}$

System must be uniform and homogeneous

May not be used for heterogeneities 

May not be used for reflected systems, if either the reflector density, or if the core density changes are not uniform

## Find new critical dimension due to density change

16.8 kg metal sphere of plutonium has a density of 19.8 g/cc at room temperature

Upon heating the sphere will expand to a new density of 15.6 g/cc

$16.8(\frac{19.8}{15.6})^{-2} = 10.4 \; kg$ new critical mass
