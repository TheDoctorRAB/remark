# NE535: Criticality safety I 
## Project 11 
### Criticality safety evaluations 
####[300]

<p>
1. [Nuclear criticality safety evaluation for contact handled transuranic waste at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plan](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/2_nuccriticalityassessment_shieldedcontainers.pdf)

<p>
2. [Preparation of nuclear criticality safety evaluations](https://ncsp.llnl.gov/docs/training/ncset/NCSET_Module_12_100803_1.pdf)

<p>
3. [DOE-STD-3007-2017 - Preparing criticality safety evaluations at Department of Energy nonreactor facilities](https://www.standards.doe.gov/standards-documents/3000/3007-AStd-2017)

Prepare a set of slides for this project. Please work in groups. We will spend most of the class in discussing this project. 

### WIPP
<p>
1. What is WIPP? What types of waste are emplaced at WIPP?

<p>
2. Briefly describe the process to emplace the waste container in the underground.

<p>
3. What controls are assumed in place prior to the CSE?

<p>
4. What are two bounding container configurations? How do they maintain criticality safety?

<p>
5. What validation was performed to ensure the adequacy of the modeling software? What modeling software was used?

<p>
6. What is FGE? Why does WIPP use the FGE concept?

<p>
7. Briefly summarize and assess the evaluated contingencies.

<p>
8. What are the two design basis accidents? Why are they considered design basis accidents?

<p>
9. Describe how the controls put in place to prevent a criticality.

<p>
10. Supplemental analysis has been conducted to support the body of the CSE and is listed in the appendices. How does this material support criticality safety?

<p>
11. Does the accident analysis provide justification that the double contingency principle has been adhered to? Provide supporting arguments. Or not, if it was not adhered to.
___
### General CSE for beaker leaching operations
<p>
1. Describe the boundary.

<p>
2. How is criticality controlled downstream beyond the boundary?

<p>
3. What validation was performed to ensure the adequacy of the modeling software? What modeling software was used?

<p>
4. What is the USL? How is the USL justified?

<p>
5. What are the possible accident scenarios? How likely are they? Use a risk matrix. 

<p>
6. How does the What-If tables tie back into the process sections?

<p>
7. What documentation is provided to ensure that the computer model or hand calculation is representative of the various scenarios?

<p>
8. Describe the controls installed to ensure subcriticality.

<p>
9. What operation and/or parameterdoes the control specifically limit?
