# Learning objectives

Evaluating criticality safety 

Constructing documentation related to criticality safety 
---
### There is a host of regulations over criticality safety

[DOE O 420.1C, Facility Safety](https://www.directives.doe.gov/news/new-doe-o-420-1c-chg-2-minchg-facility-safety) - Requirement for criticality safety program

[ANSI/ANS-8.19-2014](https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ansi/ansians192014) - Administrative practices for nuclear criticality safety

[DOE-STD-3007-2017](https://www.standards.doe.gov/standards-documents/3000/3007-AStd-2017) - Preparing Criticality Safety Evaluations at Department of Energy Nonreactor Nuclear Facilities

[10 CFR 830 Subpart B](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2011-title10-vol4/CFR-2011-title10-vol4-part830/context) - Safety basis requirements, 'documented safety analysis' that is system/facility specific and covers all facility hazards

[10 CFR 70](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part070/) - Domestic licensing of special nuclear material

DSA can be provided as a supplement to the SAR

CSE is a small part of the overall DSA
---
### The CSE is usually a stand alone document

It serves as the technical basis for the accident scenario, mitigation strategy, and control requirements

The CSE(s) will feed directly into the SAR

Engineering evaluation(s) will feed into the CSE(s)

Document methodologies, calculations, and research activities that are used to develop the controls used to ensure a system remains sub-critical during normal and credible accident/abnormal conditions

ANSI/ANS-8.1 requires -  
*Before a new operation with fissionable material is begun, or before an existing operation is changed, it shall be determined that the entire process will be subcritical under both normal and credible abnormal conditions*
---
### Definitions

**Credible** - the attribute of being believable on the basis of commonly acceptable engineering judgment  

Due to the general lack of statistically reliable data, assigning numerical probabilities to events is not usually justifiable and when used should be backed up with references

This seems surprising

**Unlikely** - the attribute of being improbable on the basis of commonly acceptable engineering judgment

An unlikely event is an event that is not expected to occur more than once in the lifetime of a facility (like design basis)

Still no probabilities though
---
### The use of should, shall, and may have very specific meanings regarding nuclear operations

**Should** - means that a process is highly recommended

**Shall** - used to delineate a requirement

**May** - the owner/operators discretion and any acceptable practice is considered adequate
---
### The CSE purpose is to communicate the analysis used to derive the limits and controls that will ensure safe operation

Explain the basis for the assumptions and conclusions

Support the conclusions with appropriately validated calculations and references

Provide enough detail and clarity such that another Criticality Safety Professional with a similar background and familiarity with the process can read, understand, and judge the conclusions
---
### CSE flowchart

1. Familiarization with operations and the facility

2. Description of methodology

3. Identification of the scope of normal operations

4. Identification of contingencies that could affect criticality safety

5. Analysis of normal operations and contingencies

6. Derivation of controls and operating limits 

7. Prepare the document
---
### Let's break it down some more

Gather information about the process/system 

Understand the physical, chemical, and radiological parameters used in the systems including the primary and auxiliary systems

Examine neighboring systems to ensure no cross effects by establishing system boundaries

Identify the potential criticality accident scenarios by applying risk assessment techniques -  
HAZOP  
Preliminary hazards analysis  
Failure modes and effects  
Event trees might be useful for outcomes happening in sequence

Interviews with personnel, process data, and system operational experiences
---
### This is really a form of risk assessment

Once accident scenarios have been identified look for ways to eliminate the hazard

Modify the facility/system or process to eliminate the initiating event

Select accident scenario(s) -   
Apply passive controls  
Apply active controls  
Apply administrative controls

Administrative controls can be used to reinforce the reliability of the engineered systems
---
Document the technical basis for nuclear criticality safety including the elements necessary for compliance with ANSI/ANS-8.1 Section 4.1.2

*Entire process will be subcritical under both normal and credible abnormal conditions*
---
### 1. Understanding the system

Rely on operational personnel as a starting point, but the analyst must remain objective

Good communication is critical (see what I did there?)   
Seriously don't yell at anyone

Obtain existing documents -  
SAR  
Prior DSA  
Procedures  
Historical records  

Walkthrough and interviews with personnel  
Look at
