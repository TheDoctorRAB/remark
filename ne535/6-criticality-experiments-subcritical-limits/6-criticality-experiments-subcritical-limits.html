# Learning objectives

Demonstrating past criticality experiments and accidents

Calculating subcritical limits

Assessing criticality safety

## The [Sarov Criticality Accident](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1106_scr.pdf) occurred on 17 June 1997

[Russian Federal Nuclear Center](http://www.vniief.ru/en/nuclearcentre/)

Uranium Sphere

Copper Reflectors

Experiment on a vertical split table

Various sets of nesting fissile and non-fissile hemi-shells exist to allow for a variety of experimental configurations

Assemblies are constructed by consecutively stacking the hemi-shells together into the desired configuration

# The apparatus was supposed to be controlled remotely

Control room behind an ~3 meter thick concrete shielding wall

Table - The lower part can be moved vertically up and down using hydraulics attached to the table

Carriage – The upper part on the carriage is movable in the horizontal direction
---
## They were recreating a past experiment

Designed as an experimental tool to study fission reactions relevant to the design and development of power reactors and research and impulse reactors

Uranium sphere reflected by a copper hemisphere

Using handwritten notes from the original logbook (#fancy)

Documented procedures specify  
Known subcritical portion of the assembly is constructed   
Then moved to a position  
From there it can be raised and lowered by a motor

Flux is constantly measured - visually displayed in the working area and converted into an audible signal
---
## Configuration is constructed manually

Lower portion successive layering of various materials  
Copper, steel and uranium  
Sets of machined hemispherical shells   
Lowered into position

Upper portion is stationary but can assemble reflector components

When completed, technician is supposed to leave
---
## A criticality event is an anticipated event

A critical assembly is low power fast reactor

Such a system has the capability to regulate itself to a steady state

Design of experimental building takes into account the worst case accident scenario, in which the criticality condition is sufficiently exceeded such that the components of the assembly melt

The building incorporates a containment to prevent the spread of any contamination

If preset limits are exceeded, SCRAM system drops the lower assembly away from the upper assemble and stops the criticality

## Technician was working alone because of course

Misread (handwritten) notes and used a 265 mm reflector instead of a 205 mm reflector

Dropped the upper reflector shell on the bottom assembly

Went critical, but actually stayed critical

100 MW burst then settled around 480 W

### Exposure led to death within three days

**17 June 1997**  
1040 - criticality accident  
1052 - technician informed supervisors and colleagues  
1059 - initial measurements of neutron induced gamma radiation emitted by Na-24 in his body indicate a whole body dose of about 1000 rad   
1145 - nausea and vomiting  
1500 - fatigue, dizziness, headache, shivering, confusion, excessive perspiration  

**20 June 1997**  
0320 - (66.5 hr. after exposure): death due to heart failure

25000 rad dose to hands

4500 rad whole body dose due to neutrons

350 rad whole body dose due to gamma rays 
---
## There was no contaimination within the experimental hall

Another detector was placed in a shielded feedthrough to monitor changes in neutron flux

Determined that neutron flux was relatively stable, indicating that the chain reaction was self-regulating

Vvisual check of the experimental hall was carried out using a periscope which allowed the emergency response team to take photographs from a door leading into the hall

Revealed that the critical assembly was located in the lower part of its stand and not possible to change the system’s configuration by means of the normal control system
---
## How to terminate the chain reaction?

Ad hoc committee of specialists proposed approaches to the problem

Changing the configuration remotely -  
Mechanically   
Chemical means  
Use of a controlled explosion  
Gas or plasma cutting  

Separate calculations were made to model the effects of various actions on the system’s criticality, including the likely effects on the generation of heat and radiation
---
## Operators could not enter the room due to the continuing criticality

Several attempts made to disassemble the experiment 

7 days after initiation, “vacuum gripper” removes copper hemi-shell 

Uranium reached 865C

1E19 fissions

![Sarov robot](img/sarov.robot.jpg)

## How they actually fixed this catastrophe

1. Remove containers of nuclear materials which had not been used in the construction of the assembly using a robot  
2. Remotely alter assembly configuration using the robot  

Thin walled conical vacuum suction device connected to a hose was suspended on the hook of the overhead crane  
The suction device was then placed over the upper (copper) hemisphere covering the enriched uranium core

Movement of the critical assembly as this was done resulted in an approximately fourfold increase in neutron flux and an increase in temperature

Once the suction device was actuated and the configuration of the assembly altered, the chain reaction was stopped and the neutron output decreased as expected to the background level
---
'3. Assembly was then removed using the crane and placed on to a stand for final dismantling at a later time

Terminated 0045 24 June

Operations to place the experiment into a favorable configuration was achieved at 0120

---
### What did they screw up? (Or, lessons learned)

Poorly documented procedures

Accident may have been anticipated with good risk assessment

No review and approval process for experiments

Remote operation was limited (manual assembly)

No scram system
---
## Why do we need these experiments though?

Provide important basis for criticality safety

If the experiment conditions match the process conditions, results can be directly applied

Usually the experiment results are used in conjunction with calculations - validate codes

Or provide benchmarks

Establish safety margins to allow for uncertainty
---
## How is $k_{EFF}$ measured experimentally?

Use a neutron source

Compute neutron generation rate for each cycle

A neutron source emitting 100 n/generation into a system with $k_{EFF} = 0.6$ gives 250 neutrons per cycle

Can we do this out?
---

![Inverse k](img/inverse.k.jpg)
---
## [Subcritical multiplication](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph241/alnoaimi2/docs/Nuclear-Volume2.pdf) is defined to estimate criticality

$M \equiv \frac{1}{1-k_{EFF}}$

But $M \rightarrow \infty$ when approaching criticality

So instead use the inverse

$\frac{1}{M}=\frac{CR_0}{CR}$

Can be used to find the [control rod height at critical](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10132997)
---
## What are the benefits to criticality experiments?

Experiment actually achieves criticality

Determine critical dimensions for individual units

Measure critical spacing of arrays

Determine the effect of reflectors, poisons, or moderators

Understanding supercritical configurations

Use inverse multiplication to measure criticality

Validate codes
---
## *Sub*critical experiments also provide value

Verify inplace material configurations (storage)

Pattern of loading

Establish safe geometric parameters - diameter, thickness, volume, etc.

Estimate criticality

Published data is important to use for comparisons and benchmarking

Subcritical limits are used to generate facility operating parameters
---
### Subcritical limit definition

The limiting value assigned to a controlled parameter that results in a subcritical system under specified conditions. The subcritical limit allows for uncertainties in the calculations and experimental data used in its derivation but not for contingencies: e.g., double batching or failure of analytical techniques to yield accurate values.
