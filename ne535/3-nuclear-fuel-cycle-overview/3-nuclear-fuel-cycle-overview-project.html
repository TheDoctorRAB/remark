_Use standard assumptions: constant distribution coefficient, complete mixing, fresh solvent, etc. **In problems 3-8, please address how the solution affects the engineering design of a commercial scale PUREX facility.**_

<p>
1. [10] Derive an expression for $\frac{F}{P}$ and $\frac{W}{P}$ explicitly in terms of $x_F,x_P,x_W$. 

<p>
2. [10] Plot $\frac{SWU}{F}$ as a function of $x_P$. There is an interesting implication(s) of this curve, which we talked about, in terms of the JPCOA. What is it? Note that medical isotopes require $x_P = 0.20$.

<p>
3. [20] Prove that the extract concentration (yN) can be expressed as:

$y_N = \frac{\beta^N - 1}{\beta - 1}(Dx_1 - y_0) + y_0$

<p>
4. [20] Now eliminate $x_1$ by applying an ‘overall material balance’ to the above expression; i.e., a material balance on stage 1 and stage N.

<p>
5. [20] Finally, using the definition of fractional recovery of the extractable component $\rho$ and extraction factor $\beta$, into the result from (4) above, and eliminate $y_N$.

<p>
6. [20] Derive the decontamination factor $f_{AB}$ based on the result in (5) for both $y_0 = 0$ and $y_0 \neq 0$. What does the decontamination factor actually mean? How does the efficiency compare if $y_0 = 0$ or $y_0 \neq 0$?

<p>
7. [25] Consider a multistage extraction system with two extractable components. What is the theoretical maximum for the decontamination factor? (i.e., as $N \rightarrow \infty$) based on both results from before. The extraction factor for U is 5 and for Tc is 0.01. What is the decontamination factor? What does it mean?  

<p>
8. [25] Show that for an extraction factor less than unity, complete extraction is impossible, even if an infinite number of stages is available. When (or would) there be a case where the extraction factor would be less than unity?

<p>
9. [25] Write a short op-ed piece (500 words or so) on ‘Into Eternity.’ Do you think the safety of a repository is feasible centuries into the future? What would you say to future society about the repository?

<p>
10. [25] Everyone agrees that a ‘consent-based approach’ must be used when siting any nuclear facility. However, no one really says what this would look like. From an engineering perspective, we want models and easily quantifiable metrics. Within this context, what might a consent-based approach look like?
