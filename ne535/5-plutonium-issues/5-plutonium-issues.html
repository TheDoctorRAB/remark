# Learning objectives

Understanding the challenges of plutonium criticality safety

Assessing plutonium criticality accidents

Would there be more, less, same risk of criticality accidents with plutonium v uranium?
---
## Two isotopes of plutonium are of interest

$^{238}Pu,^{239}Pu$

Fissile material - nuclide capable of undergoing fission after thermal neutron capture  

Fissionable material - nuclide capable of undergoing fission after either fast or thermal neutron capture

Fertile material - can be converted to fissile material by irradiation in a reactor

Which is what?
---
### Material-at-risk is a bounding quantity of radioactive material that is available to be acted upon by a given physical stress from a postulated accident

MAR may be the total inventory in a facility or a portion of this inventory in one location/operation, depending on event

MAR values shall be consistent with the hazard identification/evaluation, and

MAR values shall be bounding with respect to each accident being evaluated
---
## Los Alamos has a [plutonium facility](https://www.lanl.gov/about/_assets/docs/fact-sheets/ta-55-factsheet.pdf)

Began operations in [1978](https://youtu.be/PZxA3FVUwvk)

233,000 square-foot PF-4 building was constructed to withstand 200-mile-per-hour winds, and any credible [seismic event](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/12/f19/Keilers-%20LANL%20PF-4%20Seismic%20Safety.pdf)

They hold the pluonium stockpile - production and R&D

$^{238}Pu$ heat source fabrication, surveillance, production, dismantlement, and materials management

Maintain a critical skill base of plutonium expertise across a broad suite of technical capabilities. These capabilities form a center of excellence for actinide science and technology, including world-class manufacturing capabilities for solving significant national security challenges
---
### [Defense nuclear facilities safety board](https://www.dnfsb.gov/) is an independent organization within the executive branch of the United States Government

Responsibility of providing recommendations and advice to the President and the Secretary of Energy regarding public health and safety issues at Department of Energy defense nuclear facilities

[42 U.S.C. 2286a(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2286a)
  
Improve Safety of Operations  
Strengthen Safety Standards  
Strengthen Safety in Design   
Achieve Excellence in Management and Communication with Stakeholders
---
### 25th and 26th Annual Reports to Congress summarized deficiencies in the nuclear criticality safety program at the LANL Plutonium Facility

Documented safety analysis (DSA) and the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) rely inappropriately on planned seismic upgrades to safety systems that:  
(1) will not be implemented for many years and   
(2) are not sufficient to address adequately the bounding seismic accident scenarios

Appropriate compensatory measures to protect public and worker health and safety have not been identified

Safety strategy is based on the assumption that future upgrades to reinforce the support stands for a limited set of “high-risk” gloveboxes
---
Recommendations include  
Removing inventory from susceptible locations  
Storing material in robust containers  
Additional restrictions on MAR  
Reducing the likelihood of a fire during a seismic event
---
## DOE developed actions to respond to the criticisms

Automatic equipment shutdown to reduce ignition sources  
Eliminate unnecessary ignition sources  
Installation of fire rated safes  
Container testing  
Scoping for seismic upgrades to fire suppression and active confinement ventilation systems  
Repairing the main Plutonium Facility fire barrier wall  
Removal of SNM  
Submitted initial safety analysis for revised container 
---
### DNFSB recommends additional near-terms measures to reduce the consequences of a potential earthquake-induced collapse

Site contractor completed its own detailed analysis and identified previously unknown structural weaknesses that could result in PF-4 collapsing during an earthquake

Result in postulated offsite dose consequences that could significantly exceed DOE’s guideline for protecting the public
---
Other criticality concerns included -   
Staffing shortage  
Many procedures did not include criticality safety controls  
Operators typically did not utilize written procedures when performing fissile material operations  
Packages containing fissile material were not labeled with parameters relevant to criticality safety  
Some credible abnormal conditions were not properly analyzed in criticality safety evaluations  

So they weren't doing so well

On June 27, 2013 the laboratory director paused all programmatic activities
---
### Los Alamos implemented corrective actions in 2014

Ensuring that operating procedures can be performed as written

Incorporating criticality safety controls into operating procedures

Designating important operating procedures as “Use Every Time” procedures

Reducing the plutonium mass limits to the minimum needed for specific operations, and

Delivering refresher training on criticality safety and conduct of operations to all fissile material handlers

Resumed PF-4 operations that pose a lower criticality safety risk, and completed readiness assessments for four of eight higher-risk operations in 2015
---
## This all apparnetly stemmed from a 2011 incident

[A near-disaster at a federal nuclear weapons laboratory takes a hidden toll on America’s arsenal](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/near-disaster-federal-nuclear-weapons-laboratory-takes-hidden-toll-america-s-arsenal)

When the Energy Department on Feb. 1 released its annual [report card](https://www.dnfsb.gov/sites/default/files/document/10666/DOE%20Letter_2016%20Metrics%20Report_Feb-1-2017.pdf) reviewing criticality risks at each of its 24 nuclear sites, ranging from research reactors to weapon labs, Los Alamos singularly did “not meet expectations.”

NNSA considers the programmatic deficiences in the LANS nuclear criticality safety program to be of [high safety significance](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/09/f26/LANS%20PNOV%20%28NEA-2015-02%29%20-%20web.pdf)
