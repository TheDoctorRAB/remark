Prof. Richard N. Christensen, University of Idaho-Idaho Falls (CAES)  
Nuclear Engineering Program Director

Prof. Brian Jaques - Boise State Univeristy

class: center,middle

## Backstory

#### (Briefly)
---
## Not your typical research project

Sakae wanted to apply aluminum casting and plate designs to the nuclear market

Dr. Marc Skinner (former Executive Officer IF) approached Sakae through REDI and our State Senator Kelly Anthon

Marc introduced the Sakae team to Prof. Christensen at a reception in Blackfoot that I apparently wasn't invited to in 2017

Rich drew up a concept on a napkin, as he does, for a used fuel cooling cask (PWR) that could apply their casting technology

A few weeks later, I saw everyone walking around CAES, so I stuck my nose in, as I do, and got involved 

Then we roped in Brian 
---
## What is unique about Sakae?

Casting technology is a vacuum process using sand molds (won 'green' awards)

Method of casting the aluminum and the cooling tubes allows for more efficient heat transfer

Process costs less overall 
---
## The Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission awards funds for products to go to market

We submitted an application in May 2017 - 2 years to design, fabricate, test prototype (Not a typical proposal)

We didn't get it but worked on the feedback over the summer to submit in September 2017

We were invited to the big city in Boise to present the proposal to the Council

Interesting to be reviewed in real time

After fielding their questions, they settled on a year of funding to model, design, and work on a market plan

---
## What is the motivation for the project?

Assume everyone knows what used fuel is and what a pool is

We argue that there are some used fuel pools filling up  

Assemblies need several years cooling before transfer to standard dry casks   

Understand that some are transferred sooner - not necessarily internationally

Design a cask that could serve as an intermediate option between pool and dry storage

Intended for onsite storage - not a dual purpose cask - storage only
---
## I did a ton of market research - Highlights

**United States**  
Should be well known enough  
63% capacity (2017)  
'Healthy' dry cask program 

**South Korea**  
70% capacity over 4 sites (2014)  
Reracking and moving fuel from old sites to new

**Taiwan**  
97% capacity (2015)    
Restart of NPP denied by federal government due to lack of storage  
Local government rejected dry cask plan 
---
**Japan**  
55% capacity (2013) - Rokkasho almost filled (2018)  
Dry casks in use but expansion requires local government approval   
Combined wet and dry capacity at 71% (2018)

**France**  
Most fuel stored at La Hague - onsite storage short  
Plans for 8000 MTHM centralized storage

**UK**  
Only 1 PWR  
Dry cask construction started in 2016 - fuel loading in 2017
Could not find any % capacities
---
**Germany**  
Well known enough here - phasing out NPPs  
Dry cask storage extensive - 2 decades  
Could not find any % capacities

**Belgium**  
Similar to Germany - phasing out NPPs  
Some dry cask storage   
Empty pools at sites of shutdown NPPs and new pool constructed on active site  
Could not find any % capacities

Basically ran out of useful information at this point

Did not include Finland and Sweden
---
## What are the major takeaways from this part? 

Turns out hard numbers on used fuel pool capacities were really hard to find

Active NPP nations that are once through and not phasing out

For the most part, Europe doesn't seem to be a potential market

Most Asian countries lack robust dry storage

United States could go either way  

Ideally would like to talk to US energy companies
---
## We have several challenges to design 

Effective heat removal - Rich+Winfred

Materials optimization - Brian+Sam   
About 12% $B_4C$ solid solution with $Al$ but pouring problems

Shielding - How thick will the cask be? How much $^{10}B$ do we need? - Coming up  
Occupational safety (dose)

Licensing - What are the right regulations? What is needed for licensing? - Coming up

Market penetration - Who wants it? - Sakae - Next

Realistically, the cask probably will only be effective for certain fuel types

---
## Sakae attended several exhibitions worldwide to engage companies

This was a discussion we had with the IGEM council


---
## I used ORIGEN for burnup and depletion

Thanks to Steve Skutnik for some slides

Divided the cases in to low burnup, typical burnup, high burnup  

(Read - N-XXYY - X.X% and YY GWD/MTU)

**L-3030**,L-3530,L-3033,L-3133,L-3233,L-3533,L-3240,L-3540,L-4040  
T-4045,T-4545,T-5045,T-4050,T-4250,T-42550,T-4550,T-5050  
H-4555,H-5055,H-4560,**H-5060**

Westinghouse 17x17 PWR  
515 day cycle length and pool cooling (decay) from discharge out to 20 years

## Cask design with MCNP

#### (oh no)
---
# What's the plan?

I decided that the cask probably would only be useful for older fuel

I wanted to start with a neutron shielding model  

Cm-144 shown in ORIGEN simulations to be dominant emitter across the board

Start with initial Sakae cask design

Simulate neutron emission for dose

Vary $B_4C$ weight percent in the plates

Vary thickness

# MCNP modeling notes for your interest

<img src="img/single.assembly_plan.view_small.jpg" align="left">

Cask has backfill   
Filled with different materials

Lattice card 17x17 unit cells - pitch 12.54 mm

Material card taken from ORIGEN output 

Pipes equally positioned on plates  
More can be added

"Welds" are separate cells  
Material can be changed independently
---
# MCNP output notes for your interest

Standard defaults for dose card

SDEF card - 5 source points per rod (POS)

ERG = Spontaneous Cm fission energy distribution

F2 tally for outward normal on each plate

NPS 1E6 passed all tests for error and VOV  

Few where cap and plug had slope 2.9

Few where FOM trend during last half of problem

Equal(ish) dose rates off plates - showing results for west plate

class: center,middle

## What's next?
---
## What design and modeling enhancements can be made? 

Stick with modeling L-3030 and H-5060

Design review with the team to bound realistic boron loading and plate thickness

Add Cs-137 source

Vary backfill material

Put the cask in something else 

Determine significance of neutron activation of aluminum  
Beta emission at 2.7 MeV and gamma emission at 1.8 MeV

Find students I can actually pay to help me
